CONFIGURATION

After installation, there's not much configuration to do.

Mail configuration:
Go to <yoursite>/admin/settings/forges and fill in the form (Subject is the subject of the mail, body the actual mail)


Permissions:
Set all roles that need to be able to alter the mail settings to "edit forges mail"
Set all roles that need to receive a mail after each cron run to "receive forges mail"


Content types:
You can also add some CCK fields to the content types if you want. Just make sure the ones that've been created, remain there.
