1. Added an admin settings page that enables these options:
	a. vote tracking by cookie
	b. unlimited voting
2. Eliminated old variable_get calls. None of them had matching variable_set calls.  Consolidated everything
   into advpoll_settings variable where appropriate.
3. Both cookie and unlimited voting behave the same for authenticated and anonymous users.
4. Cookie voting on the admin form also allows setting of a global duration value.  
5. Cookies are generated for each poll by node ID.
6. There is an option in the admin panel to override the native Approval Voting behavior of multiple choice polls
   and some all votes the same.
7. Changed vote percentage calculation to float rather than round to prevent a total greater than 100%.
8. Moved global messaging into admin form so that phrasing can be customized to suit.
9. Cleaned up install file, removed D5 style update hooks.

1. Overhauled block display - removed dependency on Views for generating blocks of additonal 
   polls because it did not play well with Varnish and Memcached.  Polls that are marked 
   to generate a block do so now through the standard hook_block method.
2. Removed datetimepicker folder as the date fields now use standard Date API display and the
   included files were not being used.

1/27/2012
1. Updated write-ins functionality to prevent empty or double results, particularly in 
   cases where configuration is set to allow unlimited voting.
2. Implemented optional footer message, updated preprocess and templates to reflect update.
3. General cleanup - removed some commented out items, variables that weren't being used/set.
