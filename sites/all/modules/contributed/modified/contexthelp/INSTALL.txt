================================================================
INSTALLING CONTEXT HELP ON YOUR SITE
================================================================
Please note currently i do not know of a way to automatically create CCK nodes in the 
system when a module is first installed hence i have created two files in the top level
directory that were created using Content Copy and can be imported into your system.

1) Download the module from d.o. and place it as a sub module in your modules
directory for your site.

2) Go to Admin / Site Building / Modules and check the checkbox next to the module then
click the "Save Configuration" button at the bottom of the screen. (This will install
the module in the system and will also automatically install two views the module utilizes).

At this point Context Help is now installed on your system and should work correctly.

If you have any help context then you can start creating it the usual way with node/add/<type>
where <type> is based off the context help type you configure in the configuration section below.

==================================================================
User Permissions
==================================================================
Context help module supports two user permissions 'administer context help' and 'context help view'
If you want a user to be able to see contexthelp they should have the context help view priviledge set
If you wish the user to be able to administer the module and change permissions they should have the 
administer context help permission.

For editing / updating etc the permissions for this will be in the content type since we are using 
CCK nodes for the context help hence you should enable per user role the pertinent functionality 
based off what the content module provides.

==================================================================
CONFIGURATION CONTEXT HELP MODULE
==================================================================
In order to utilize the context help module you should go to the Admin / Site Configuration / 
Context Help page in order to let the module know which node type it should use as the 
context help node type and which node type it should use as the FAQs node type. These are the 
node types that were created from the CONTEXTHELPCCK and FAQCCK files that you imported above
Once this is done the module is ready to be utilized.

==================================================================
INSTALLING PRE-DEFINED ADMINISTRATION PAGES HELP
==================================================================
Once you have configured the context help module and chosen your Help and FAQ node types you can 
import the help for the administration section of the system that we have provided for the module.
This help can be found under the help directory and basically when you go too admin / contexthelp /
import and paste the output of that file into the textarea in order too create the help.
