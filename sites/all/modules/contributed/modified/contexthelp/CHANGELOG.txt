CONTEXTHELP 6.x.dev
===================

CONTEXTHELP 6.x-1.0-rc3
=======================
Feature Addition:
  - #433514 added the ability for the module to add a class too the contexthelp dialog when 
            there is currently help available for that particular page.
            Added the ability for administrators to decide whether or not too show the help button 
            if the "Current Page" does not have any help associated with it.            

CONTEXTHELP 6.x-1-0-rc2
=======================
Performance Features:
  - #0 updated current view so that it utilizes pure sql based off the view instead 
       of loading all of the node ids and then doing a node load so it could match the 
       url string against the current url of the page.
  - #0 url matching for wildcards and regular urls is now done in the database query 
       thus speeding up the system since we do not have to continually check on each 
       node (as described above) in php.
  - #0 updated content permissions so that 

Bug fixes:
  - #0 fixed css issue where the li item lists would not display correctly due 
       too the css for the accordian over-writing the system

CONTEXTHELP 6.x-1-0-Beta2
=========================

Main features:
  - #415122 Added the ability to go back to the node edit when using the save 
            draft functionality on an existing node. This will save the system 
            creating a new node every time and will instead update the existing
            node already created in the system.

Bug fixes:
  - #418314 Updating the FCKEditor code so that the html is there before it finishes
            loading that way the data is put correctly in the FCKEditor box for the 
            textarea
  - #416100 Added handling so the module would not fail if the content module 
            does not exist in the users installation. Do not want to make the 
            content module a dependency so have added code to fallback to a default
            if the content module does not exist. (This code was introduced 
            originally to handle the admin selecting the Title and Body field from 
            the content types list of known fields supplied by the content module)

DRAFT 6.x-1-0-Beta1
===================

Main features:
  - #368017 Split Drafts and Views so there is no initial reliance on views
            PHP view has been added to the main drafts module so people can see
            their drafts

Module changes:
  - #379838 Portuguese - Brazilian translation (thansk to lourenzo)
  - #367165 updated default fields shown in the view (view was updated to
            accomodate the new fields we have in the database)
  - #361812 added configurable view url for the draft views module so the
            user can specify it if they change the draft view url

Bug fixes:
  - #406648 added units for the autosave interval in administrator settings
  - #367184 added same as above and also for user form settings
  - #368286 shortened the textfields utilized for autosave intervals
  - #369042 reworked so cron will not delete the draft is the admin specifies
  - #367171 updated the processing draft moved to right hand corner instead of
            bulky div in the middle of the users screen
  - #353252 fixed bug with node names and underscores not being handled properly
  - #367180 provided user feedback when draft was loading since it looked like
            nothing was happening for the draft populate form timeout
  - #348165 code updated for the FCKEditor and verified with their site to work
  - #361809 fixed issue where preview button would stop drafts from being saved
