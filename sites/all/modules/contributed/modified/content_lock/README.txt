-- Fork --

This module is a fork of the module http://drupal.org/project/checkout and has 
been nearly completely reweritten since then

-- SUMMARY --
This module implements a pessimistic locking strategy, which means that content
will be exclusively locked whenever a user starts editing it.  The lock will be
automatically released when the user submits the form or navigates away from
the edit page.

Content locks that have been "forgotten" can be automatically released after a
configurable time span using the bundled content_lock_timeout submodule.

-- INSTALLATION --

1. Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.

2. Configure user permissions at User management >> Permissions:

   check out documents - This enables content locking when a user starts
     editing it.  Note that even without this permission, users are still
     able to edit contents, they're just not protected against concurrent
     edits.

   administer checked out documents - View and release locked contents of all
     users.  This enables the administrative tab on Content management >>
     Content.  Note that even without this permission, users can manage their
     own content locks on their profile page.

3. Configure the module at Site Configuration >> Content lock.

    Use javascript to detect leaving the node form - Automatically unlock nodes
      when users navigate away from a node edit page by clicking miscellaneous
      links. Also prompts user when trying to navigate away from a node edit page.

    Show lock / unlock message - Make content_lock more verbose, informing a
      user when he locks a node and about his inconsideration when he visits
      one node while he has kept another node locked.

    Add cancel button - Adds a link in a node's edit form to cancel the edit,
      letting the user intentionally navigate away from the Edit page without
      being asked for confirmation by a javascript dialog.

    Lockable content types - You may choose to limit content_lock's effects
      to specific node types instead of across the board. Do not select any
      content types to ensure that all content types are protected.

    Lockable text formats - You may choose what type of node input formats
      may be lockable. Do not select any input types if content_lock should
      protect all input types.

4. If you want stale locks to time out, enable the content_lock_timeout
    ("Content Locking (edit lock) timeouts") module. Then return to the
    Content Lock settings page.

5. View and administer locked nodes Content management >> Content >>
    Locked Documents.
