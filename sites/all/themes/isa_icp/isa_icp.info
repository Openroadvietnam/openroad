	; "core" specifies the version of Drupal that this theme is compatible with.
	; The "engine" field uses individual 'something.tpl.php' files to theme Drupal's 'theme_something()' functions.
	; Drupal's themeable functions are documented on the Drupal API site [http://api.drupal.org/api/5].
	; Every file contains an HTML skeleton with some simple PHP statements for the dynamic data.
	; Thus, PHPTemplate is an excellent choice for theming if you know a bit of PHP: with some basic
	; PHP snippets, you can create advanced themes easily.

	; This section adds CSS files to your theme. The media type is specified in

	; list of stylesheet media types in CSS 2.1. The iPhone's preferred media type
	; is based on the CSS3 Media queries. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/

	; The regions defined in the page.tpl.php file. The name in brackets
	; is the name of the variable in the page.tpl.php file, (e.g. "[content_top]"
	; in the .info file means there should be a $content_top variable in the
	; page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a descriptive text
	; used on the admin/build/blocks page.

	; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
	; "features" control which of these check boxes display on the
	; admin/build/themes config page. This is useful for suppressing check boxes
	; for elements not used by your theme. To suppress a check box, omit the
	; entry for it below. See the Drupal 6 Theme Guide for more info:
