It  has been created on the initiative of the European Commission. It is now  approved by the European Commission in 22 official languages of the European  Union and can be used by anyone for software distribution.</p> <p>Following an intensive preparatory process and a public consultation, it was  approved by the European Commission on 9 January 2007 in three linguistic  versions.</p> <p>By a second Decision of 9 January 2008, the European Commission validated the  EUPL in 22 official languages of the European Union.</p> <p>By a third decision of 9 January 2009, the European Commission adopted a  revised version of the Licence while at the same time validated it in 22&nbsp;  official languages (EUPL v.1.1).</p> <p>The EUPL is a unique legal instrument, as it has been elaborated in respect  of European law requirements and has legal value in 22 European languages.</p> <p>More than 100 other F/OSS licences exist. The purpose of the EUPL is not to  compete with any of these licences, but to encourage first of all, a new wave of  public administrations to embrace the Free/Open Source model to valorise their  software and knowledge, starting with the European Institutions  themselves.</p> The EUPL is compatible with some other copyleft licences,  including the GPLv2. The first applications developed inside the European  Commission or by national public administration have already been published  under the EUPL. <p align="right">[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-0"></a> <h2><a name="what-is-the-eupl"></a>What is the EUPL?</h2> <p>EUPL is an acronym&nbsp; for &ldquo;European Union Public Licence&rdquo;.</p> <p>The first EUPL draft (v.0.1) went public in June 2005. A public debate was  then&nbsp; organised by the European Commission (IDABC). The consultation of the  developers and users community was very productive and has lead to many  improvements of the draft licence; 10 out of 15 articles were modified. Based on  the results of these modifications (a detailed report and the draft EUPL v.0.2),  the European Commission&nbsp; elaborated a final version (v.1.0) that was officially  approved on 9 January 2007, in three linguistic versions.</p> <p><br /> By a second Decision of 9 January 2008, the European Commission validated  the EUPL in all the official languages of the European Union.</p> <p>By a third Decision of 9 January 2009, the European Commission clarified  specific points of the&nbsp;EUPL, publishing the version 1.1&nbsp;in all the official  languages of the European Union.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-1"></a> <h2>Why the EUPL?</h2> <p>The purpose of the European Commission is first of all to distribute its own  software under the licence. Some applications developed in the framework of the  IDABC programme, such as CIRCA, or IPM have already been licensed under the EUPL  in 2007. Other European Institutions are also interested in using the new  licence.</p> <p>But why creating a new legal instrument from scratch when more than 100 other  F/OSS licences exist, such as the GPL, the BSD or the OSL? The reason is that in  a detailed legal study no existing licence was found to correspond to the  requirements of the European Commission:</p> <ul>     <li>The Licence should have equal legal value in many languages;</li>     <li>The terminology regarding intellectual property rights had to be conformant  with European law requirements ;</li>     <li>To be valid in all Member States, limitations of liability or warranty had  to be precise, and not formulated &ldquo;to the extend allowed by the law&rdquo; as in most  licences designed with the legal environment of the United States in mind.     <p align="right">[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p>     </li> </ul> <a name="section-2"></a> <h2>Objectives</h2> <p>The main objective of the European Commission is to distribute widely and  promote the use of software owned by itself and other European Institutions  under an Free/Open Source Licence conform to European law requirements.</p> <p>The EUPL is however written in neutral terms so that a broader use might be  envisaged.</p> <p>In addition, distribution of software should avoid the exclusive  appropriation of the software even after improvement by a third party  (therefore, the EUPL is a &quot;copyleft&quot; licence).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-3"></a> <h2>Who may use the EUPL?</h2> <p>Although the potential users of European Institutions\' software are mostly  other public sector administrations, there is nothing in the EUPL preventing its  broader use. The EUPL could be used by anyone who holds the copyright to a piece  of software. It could become &ndash; in various languages - an adequate legal  interoperability instrument across Europe.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the EUPL purpose is not to compete with other licences. It  might be used primarily by public administrations, either European or national,  that would need a common licensing instrument to mutualise or share software and  knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Is the EUPL compatible with the GPL and other F/OSS  licences?</strong></p> <p>Yes, it is. The EUPL contains a unique compatibility clause and provides for  a list of compatible copyleft licences. The GPL is one of them.</p> <p><strong>For example, how would the interaction between the EUPL and the GPL  play out in the case of CIRCA, an application a already distributed&nbsp; under the  EUPL?</strong></p> <p>A developer may improve CIRCA by integrating a GPL component in it, and then  could license the improved or derivative work under the GPL. A developer will be  also able to integrate CIRCA in existing GPL work called e.g. &ldquo;MY-GPL-PROGRAM&rdquo;  and continue to license this improved work under the GPL licence that he had  chosen originally.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-4"></a> <h2>The role of the IDABC programme</h2> <p>The IDABC programme has constantly supported the objective of widely  distributing its own software, such as CIRCA or IPM.</p> <p>Distribution of software under the EUPL makes possible the growth of a  stronger&nbsp; developers and users community. It also ensures ithe continued  availability of and support for these programs after the expiration of the IDABC  programme.</p> <p>To this end, the European Commission has investigated various alternatives,  submitted the EUPL to public consultation and made appropriate modifications.  The EUPL is one of the instruments to encourage the European Public sector to  develop collaborative initiatives e.g.&nbsp; in the framework of the future Open  Source Repository.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-5"></a> <h2>OSI certified</h2> <p>The EUPL v 1.1 is OSI certified as from March 2009.[<a href="#what-is-the-eupl" title="What is the EUPL?">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-6"></a></div> <p>&nbsp;</p>' WHERE `node_revisions`.`nid` =3049 and `node_revisions`.`vid` =3140 LIMIT 1;

Have you comments  on the proposed text or on the principle of a licence that is written with  European legislation in mind?</em>&rdquo; Bernhard Schnittger (IDABC team) asked. This  forum generated controversial opinions: strongly against the initiative, or  strongly in favour of it. It has a substantial impact on the draft: 10 of the 15  articles were modified and compatibility with the GPL was implemented, producing  the EUPL version 1.0 adopted by the European Commission in January 2007 in three  linguistic versions (EN/FR/DE).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next important milestone was the publication of the EUPL in 22 linguistic  versions of equal value. All translation reviewers (two lawyers per Member  State) and guest experts discussed the text in January 2008. This conference and  discussions with&nbsp;OSI produced the EUPL version 1.1, which is certified by OSI  since March 2009.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Objective and focus</h2> <p>The objective of the EUPL community is to maintain the focus on F/OSS  licensing, especially by public sector authorities. It is to exchange opinions  and experiences, to clarify issues, to explore new ideas (the previous EUPL  elaboration process has demonstrated that your opinions are important and will  be taken in consideration).</p> <p>The forum is open to all (lawyers, developers, project leaders, but not  exclusively). Provide the question is relevant to our focus and fairly  presented, there will be no taboo: Has the EUPL its place in the &ldquo;already too  many&rdquo; circle of F/OSS licences? Is maintaining 22 equivalent linguistic versions  sustainable? Should the EUPL compatibility be enlarged to licence X or Y?</p> <p>In the blog,&nbsp;community members&nbsp;will try to provide&nbsp;each other&nbsp;information  related to the EUPL and to F/OSS licensing, that may come from various  sources.</p> <p>Last, let\'s remember that the objective of the EUPL is not to compete or to  replace any existing licence: it is to&nbsp;encourage a new wave of F/OSS licensors,  especially among public administrations in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>EUPL Guidelines</h2> <p>The EUPL guidelines have  been updated for version 1.1&nbsp;</p> <h2>Practical Guide to using Free Software in the Public Sector&nbsp;</h2> <p><font color="#000000"><font face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Thierry Aim&eacute;, member of the team of the French  Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service, has authored a  &ldquo;Practical Guide to using Free Software in the Public  Sector&rdquo;.</font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br /> </font></font></font></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>' WHERE `node_revisions`.`nid` =3052 and `node_revisions`.`vid` =3143 LIMIT 1;

As the topic gained on  importance the Commission launched the GPOSS portal, which was  essentially a source of providing information regarding open source  software for public administrations. Eventually the GPOSS portal was  replaced by another platform, which allowed for actual cooperation of   projects: OSOR.eu. This platform aimed at introducing public  administrations to open source software and also to the community  dynamics behind the software. It features a variety of projects and has  several partnering websites, which contribute to further expanding the  network.</span>                      </dd>    <dt>                          <span class="contenttype-document summary">                             <a class="state-published url" href="./norwegian-mapping-authority">Norwegian Mapping Authority</a>&nbsp;</span><span class="documentByLine"><span>                                        </span>                                                                                                                                                               </span>                      </dt>    <dd>                                                   <span class="description">The Norwegian Mapping  Authority (Statens Kartverk) is the central organisation for the  provision of mapping images to most public bodies and organisations in  Norway.  After experiencing a vast increase in requests for their  services in 2006 and 2007, the Mapping Authority also had to deal with  an increasingly overstrained IT infrastructure. The licenses for their  infrastructure however were very costly, and acquiring additional  licenses would only increase the financial burden consistently in the  future. The Mapping Authority therefore chose to employ an IT  infrastructure based on open source software solutions, which were free  of licensing costs and which proved to be much better, performance wise.  In the process of introducing the new IT infrastructure, the team had  to build up own expertise in order to maintain a functioning system.  With the help of online communities, this has been a great success for  the Mapping Authority.</span>                      </dd>    <dt>                          <span class="contenttype-document summary">                             <a class="state-published url" href="./swedish-national-police">The Swedish National Police: How to avoid locking yourself in while saving money</a></span><span class="documentByLine"><span>                                        </span>                                                                                                                                                               </span>                      </dt>    <dd>                                                   <span class="description">In 2006 the Swedish  National Police launched a project that led to the implementation and  migration from an ICT  infrastructure based on proprietary products to  an ICT server and database platform based on Open Source software and  open standards. The previous ICT platform was very costly and obliged  the Police to stick with a hand full of vendors. The aim was therefore  to cut costs, avoid vendor lock-in, achieve better performance, and  introduce open standards. Before ideas were realized, a thorough study was conducted to calculate  costs and benefits. This study foresaw cost savings of up to fifty  percent over a five years period  compared to the  proprietary hardware  and software in place at this time, while improving performance at the  same time. Due to the dimensions of this project that affected the entire ICT  infrastructure of the Swedish National Police, it was not always easy to  turn ideas into reality.</span>                      </dd>    <dt>                          <span class="contenttype-document summary">                             <a class="state-published url" href="./open-university-uk-creating-win-win-situation-sharing-code-and-content">The Open University UK: creating a win-win situation by sharing code and content</a>&nbsp;</span><span class="documentByLine"><span>                                        </span>                                                                                                                                                               </span>                      </dt>    <dd>                                                   <span class="description">In 2005 The Open  University (OU) UK, one of Europe\'s largest distance learning  universities, established that it was time to deploy a new Virtual  Learning Environment (VLE), for both The Open University itself as well  as for their OpenLearn project aimed at providing free open educational  resources (OER) to the general public.  A team with different sub-tasks  was formed, which investigated future learning environments and how  learning material was presented and disseminated through those. Next to  this, the OU also researched open learning models, as part of the  OpenLearn project. The team of researchers and technical staff, after  setting out the components required to meet the OU\'s needs the most  appropriate match was determined. The choice fell on the VLE Moodle,  which is an open source product. Today the Moodle VLE has been  successfully implemented at the OU and the OU has further published a  significant amount of their learning material under a Creative Commons  license as courses on the Moodle VLE based OpenLearn website, which are  freely available to anyone interested. The OU continues to collaborate  closely with the Moodle community , as this provides a very large  platform for feedback and information. All the OU\'s development are  given back to the Moodle community, which improves the product for the  OU and the rest of the community. </span>                      </dd>    <dt>                          <span class="contenttype-document summary">                             <a class="state-published url" href="./desktop4education">Desktop4education: Bringing new environments to Austrian schools</a>&nbsp;</span><span class="documentByLine"><span>                                        </span>                                                                                                                                                               </span>                      </dt>    <dd>                                                   <span class="description">In 2003 the secondary  school of Weiz, Austria, started the development of an open source  operating system.

Although open source  software is not extensively used in Austrian schools yet, it is becoming  more and more important, as the government tries to promote free  software over proprietary solutions increasingly.

The solution had to be  secure,  adaptable, and fully featured. The IT direction of the city of Arles was  in close contact with the open source initiative OpenMairie, which  presented many software products for the use in the public sector. It  was through this relationship that the four municipalities took the  initiative to start OpenCimetiere, an open source management system for  cemeteries. This was started with an initialization phase in 2006,  followed by a contribution phase in 2007, where the software was further  improved and extended. Today, the software is used by over 300  municipalities inside and outside France, and helps an increasing number  of municipalities all over the world to manage their citizens\' final  resting places efficiently.</span>                      </dd>    <dt>                          <span class="contenttype-document summary">                             <a class="state-published url" href="./frikomport-sharing-code-costs-and-benefits">FriKomPort: Sharing code, costs, and benefits</a>&nbsp;</span><span class="documentByLine"><span>                                        </span>                                                                                                                                                               </span>                      </dt>    <dd>                                                   <span class="description">In 2006 the Norwegian  region of Kongsberg launched a portal to coordinate and administrate  courses and trainings for municipality staff. The solution was developed   with open source tools, as a common effort of all seven municipalities  of the Kongsberg region. Once the project was working successfully,  other municipalities and organisations became interested and wanted to  use the portal as well. The Kongsberg region eventually published  FriKomPort, as the portal was called, as a free software application  under the GPL. The portal today is used by more than 50 organisations,  and practically all users are very confident about the solution.

This exchange was constantly suffering  from a lack of interoperability, as data needed to be converted from one  organisation\'s convention into another, a process which consumes both  time and money. Different organisations were also using very different  tools to work with the data, which caused further problems. In late  2001, Eurostat got together with a number of EU committees to discuss  the need for greater interoperability within the European public sector.  In 2005, IDABC agreed to fund the SDMX Open DATA Interchange (SODI)  project. Thanks to previous cooperations between Eurostat and other  international institutions, the SDMX standard quickly found a large  group of sponsors, all of which hoped to benefit from the greater  interoperability afforded by using a single standard, and the tools  built on it. These tools were developed by Eurostat and other sponsoring  institutions, and many of them were published under the EUPL license.  The SDMX Converter is an example of the successful development and  publication of a tool that is essential for working with the SDMX  standard. </span>                      </dd></dl><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: black;"><br /></span></p>' WHERE `node_revisions`.`nid` =2648 and `node_revisions`.`vid` =2731 LIMIT 1;

If you  want to benefit from the support of an external community, it is always  recommended to apply a number of principles: It is recommended to start with  more than a simple idea: an efficient application kernel, easy to understand and  enrich with new functionalities is a preferred starting point. It is also  recommended to dwell on successful other Open Source standards of existing  projects: sustainability will be better if you build on such success than if you  reinvent everything alone or duplicate what others have done already.</p> <p>Concerning the development of your specific part, take care about:</p> <ol start="1">     <li>A modular design (a solid kernel facilitating the addition of several  modules)</li>     <li>The use of a version control system (which is normally provided on any  &ldquo;software forge&rdquo;)</li>     <li>A clear documentation explaining the objectives, scope, use cases and  interactions according to standards</li>     <li>An open mind team spirit, welcoming external participation, while keeping  control and setting a direction</li>     <li>Good communication and interface with the &quot;developers community&quot;&nbsp;     <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p>     </li> </ol> <a name="section-6"></a> <h2><a name="faq7"></a>How can I collaborate to a EUPL project?</h2> <p>By collaborating to an Open Source project, you will offer some of your work  (time, writing work, lines of codes) to this project. By doing this, the EUPL  requires one specific warranty from you: you must be the copyright holder of the  provided work. This warranty is provided in Article 6 of the EUPL: Contributors  warrants that the copyright in the modifications they bring to the work are  owned by (or licensed for that purpose to) them.</p> <p>Therefore, if you are an employee of a public or private organisation, it is  strongly recommended to go to your department head and obtain their green  light.</p> <p>In a second step you should identify yourself and contact the relevant  project manager, present your experience and explain your interest in  collaborating (normally, you or your organisation should have a specific need  that the project could cover). In order to avoid work disorganisation and  duplication, it is important that your role in the project will be known, that  your potential contribution will be defined and communicated to all  stakeholders, knowing who you are and what you are doing or planning to do on  which project module.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-7"></a> <h2><a name="faq8"></a>Can we translate a EUPL licensed application?</h2> <p>Facilitating the translation of EUPL licensed software (for example adapting  an eGovernment application from UK or France to Slovakia or Romania) is one of  the main potential utilities of the &ldquo;common&rdquo; EUPL licence. Adaptation is more  than simple translation on another language: it is called &ldquo;Localisation&rdquo; because  from one State to another, many parameters may vary:</p> <ul>     <li>the role of the stakeholders (depending on the organisation of the  government, of the judiciary etc... ) and the rights attached to these roles;</li>     <li>the conditions of performing a specific operation (age, cost, VAT rate,  pre-requisites);</li>     <li>the required time to perform an operation, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Therefore, before trying to translate any interesting application, it is  recommended to check that it was &ldquo;made for localisation&rdquo;. The software code  should not contain any hard-coded messages or parameters: just the logical  instructions and internal comments (usually in English) allowing readers to  understand. All displayable text and all parameters depending on location should  be stored in external files, with references to both countries and language  because several countries may share the same language (as Austria and Germany)  while in some other several languages are spoken (like in Belgium).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-8"></a> <h2><a name="faq9"></a>What are the risks of publishing software under the  EUPL?</h2> <p>Risks are extremely low and may be classified in four subcategories:</p> <blockquote><a name="section-9"></a> <h3>Copyright litigations</h3> <p>You (or your developers) have copied parts from other software without  appropriate and compatible licences or without reproducing copyright marks (this  is copyright violation). Although this may happen occasionally (however  generally for internal use and not for public re-distribution), the number of  litigations related to Open Source software copyright is extremely reduced (a  handful in ten years time) because cases are normally solved based on common  agreement. Most existing software copyright litigations involve companies with  conflicting commercial interests. In the case of a public administration  distributing its own software, risk can be mitigated by suspending distribution  during the copyright clarification, and as long as an agreement cannot be  found.</p> <a name="section-10"></a> <h3>Patent claims</h3> <p>What has been said for copyright is also true for other intellectual property  rights (i.e. patents, in the exceptional case it could be applicable). Patents  on computer programs are not allowed in European law &ldquo;as such&rdquo;, but in practice,  patents have been granted that cover functionality in many common software  applications. Patents pose a specific risk to the development of software  because they protect the idea or the method and not simply the form, as  copyright does. It is therefore possible to infring some patent without copying  anything or without even knowing it. However, users are rarely subject to legal  action for patent infringement. Developers and software licensors must almost  always be notified first, prior to legal action seeking damages, thus giving  them an opportunity to replace or remove the functionality that is possibly  patented. The risk is therefore related to higher costs for replacing this  functionality, rather than the direct costs of being subjected to patent  lawsuits. In the practice, risks appear to be higher for proprietary software,  where commercial interests are higher, than for Open Source distribution. Known  software patents, such as MP3 audio or the LZW data compression have halted  software development specific areas, but no Free / Open Source software has yet  been subject to legal action for patent infringement.</p> <p>In conclusion, when public administrations are using or distributing their  own specific software under the EUPL, the risk from legal action related to  patent infringement, while not zero, is very low.</p> <a name="section-11"></a> <h3>Warranty and Liability claims</h3> <p>Liability for such damages are generally excluded by the EUPL licence, to the  extent permissible by applicable law. Exceptions, as spelled out in Article 8 of  the licence, could be your wilful misconduct (for example by distributing a  computer virus) or direct damages to natural persons, which are not likely to  occur regarding public sector software (risks look theoretical, and it seems  that such case has never been met).</p> <a name="section-12"></a> <h3>Security risks</h3> <p>Security issues are to be considered with more attention. If your software is  well written, the publication of the source code should not facilitate security  breaches (intrusion by hackers etc.) as the code should not contain passwords,  nor sensitive or personal data as names or biometrics, or information on  possible back door etc. At the contrary, the Open Source publication of the code  should by the time reinforce software security by allowing a wider community to  screen it for possible bugs.</p> <p>However, if a software is effectively used for critical applications and if  the published source code contains serious security flaws, disclosing the code  will generate real risks of hacking, at least in a first stage, before bug  corrections. Therefore, depending on the sensitive character of the application  and the nature of accessed data, a risk assessment is recommended prior to Open  Source distribution.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> </blockquote><a name="section-13"></a> <h2><a name="faq10"></a>Why did the the European Commission create the EUPL?</h2> <p>EUPL was created by the European Commission under the IDABC programme because  it responded to a need: the Commission had the willingness to distribute the  software produced under the IDABC programme (with applications such as CIRCA, or  IPM). A decision was taken to apply Open Source licensing principles while  submitting possible redistribution to non-appropriation principles: the software  produced by the European Commission had to stay open and non-proprietary.</p> <p>None of the existing Open Source licences (more than 100 models exist) was  satisfactory regarding a series of criteria:</p> <ul>     <li>the specificity of Community and Member State\'s law regarding copyright  principles</li>     <li>the specificity of Community and Member State\'s law regarding warranty and  liability issues</li>     <li>the specificity of Community and Member State\'s law regarding applicable law  and jurisdiction</li>     <li>the requirement to obtain a text legally valid in all the official languages  of the European Union.     <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p>     </li> </ul> <a name="section-14"></a> <h2><a name="faq11"></a>What makes the EUPL unique?</h2> <p>The EUPL is unique for several reasons:</p> <ol start="1">     <li>For the first time, a public body&nbsp; of the size of the European Commission  has officially developed and approved a Free/Open Source Licence for the release  of its software, and authorises the use of the Licence by any other stakeholder.</li>     <li>The EUPL has identical value in 22 linguistic versions (all EU languages,  except&nbsp;the Irish). No similar example exists in the world.</li>     <li>The EUPL has considered the specificity and diversity of Member States Law  and the Community Law (copyright terminology, information, warranty, liability,  applicable law and jurisdiction).</li>     <li>The EUPL ensures downstream compatibility issues with the most relevant  other licences (including the most intensively used, the General Public licence  or GPL). Its unique compatibility provisions create a new category of F/OSS  licence: &quot;Copyleft compatible&quot; (other are: &quot;Strong copyleft&quot;, &quot;Weak copyleft&quot;  and &quot;Without copyleft&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;     <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p>     </li> </ol> <a name="section-15"></a> <h2><a name="faq12"></a>Were other licences screened?</h2> <p>Yes, as the EUPL elaboration that has taken more than two years started with  the evaluation of several existing licences by a team of lawyers and software  practitioners.he result of such investigation was a first report of December  2004 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=24394">&ldquo;Open Source  Licensing of software developed by the European Commission&ldquo;</a> published on the  IDABC web site.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-16"></a> <h2><a name="faq13"></a>What about new versions of the EUPL?</h2> <p>According to Article 13 of the EUPL (which was modified in the EUPL v.1.1),  the European Commission may publish new linguistic versions and/or new versions  of the EUPL, so far this is &ldquo;required and reasonable&rdquo;, and &quot;without reducing the  scope of the rights granted by the Licence&quot;. This means that:</p> <ul>     <li>the European Commission may update the licence to address new legal or  technological issues that would otherwise keep the licence from functioning as  intended.</li>     <li>Any&nbsp;new version will not change the fundamental characteristics of the  licence, such as the freedoms it grants you, the liability exemption, or its  reciprocal (or &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;) character, meaning that the exclusive appropriation  of the licensed work will not be authorised.</li> </ul> <p>The key word in Article 13 is <strong>reasonable</strong>. The European  Commission (EC) can indeed update the license, e.g. to cope with new or  previously unknown legal problems that would otherwise keep the license from  functioning as intended. However, any such changes must be reasonable, meaning  that <strong>they cannot tamper with basic characteristics</strong> of the  license, such as the freedoms it grants you, the liability exemption, or its  reciprocal character&rdquo;.</p> <p>Each new version of the Licence will be published with a unique version  number.</p> <p>It is important to note that new versions are applicable to the software  already licensed under the EUPL v.1.0, or to software that is licensed without  an explicit version number, or with the explicit provision that later versions  become applicable. As from the publication of the EUPL v.1.1 in January 2009,  new versions (if any, in the future)&nbsp;will not be applicable automatically if the  software was formally licensed &quot;under the EUPL v.1.1&quot;.&nbsp;For such software,&nbsp;the  licence upgrade will be depending on the agreement of the original author (who  keeps control on licensing modifications).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-17"></a> <h2><a name="faq14"></a>What about compatibility issues?</h2> <p>Compatibility issues are resulting from the merging or integration of your  work with other software components, when the licence of these components  provides that modified works must be distributed under the same licence.  Normally, the EUPL also does this, to protect your software against  &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo;, however this may produce licence conflicts or  &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;. Therefore EUPL foresees for &quot;compatible licences&quot;, by  allowing the resulting software to be distributed under the compatible licence  instead of under the EUPL itself.</p> <p>The compatible licences are currently defined by the EUPL as being the  following:</p> <ul>     <li>General Public licence (GPL) v. 2</li>     <li>Open Software licence (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0</li>     <li>Common Public licence v. 1.0</li>     <li>Eclipse Public licence v. 1.0</li>     <li>Cecill v. 2.0</li> </ul> <p>This list will not be reduced (anyway, as soon a merged or combined work will  be validly licensed under a compatible licence, this may not be revoked), but  could be enlarged (e.g. to later versions of the above licences).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-18"></a> <h2><a name="faq15"></a>What are jurisdiction and applicable law?</h2> <p>The EUPL refers to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the  case the European Commission is the licensor of the software. By referring to  this exception, the EUPL does not intent to create any discrimination (between  the European Commission and other stakeholders). It just reminds Article 238 of  the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p> <p>According to Article 14 of the EUPL, any litigation resulting from the  interpretation of the licence will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of  the competent court where the licensor resides or conducts its primary business.  Without impacting the validity of other EUPL provisions, it cannot be totally  excluded that due to compulsory rules, the &ldquo;court of the residence of the  consumer&rdquo; would consider itself as competent.</p> <p>According to Article 15 of the EUPL, the competent court, whatever it may  eventually be, will take its decision by applying the law of the European Union  country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office. It will be the  Belgian law if the licensor is the European Commission or - for reasons of legal  security - if the Licensor has no residence or registered office inside a  European Union country.</p> <p>By this provision, the EUPL ensures that the competent court will have &ndash; in  any case &ndash; to appreciate the EUPL rights and obligations in consideration of the  law of a European Union country.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-19"></a> <h2><a name="faq16"></a>Does EUPL deprive me from intellectual property?</h2> <p>Does the EUPL preserve your full ownership of your work? Could EUPL licensing  deprive you of potential opportunities (especially if you want to make some  money out of licensing or recover your investment)?</p> <p>By sharing your rights, you will not be deprived from your copyright or  intellectual property. You will keep full ownership of your work, especially if  you are the original author.</p> <p>You may as well decide to undertake new developments, to distribute it or  not, and if you redistribute it to re-licence your software under another  licensing agreement, or even under a proprietary licence.</p> <p>You may even manage two simultaneous distributions: an Open Source one (for  example under the EUPL) and a proprietary one (that may include additional  functionalities and be proposed for commercial fee). The name for this is &ldquo;Dual  licensing&rdquo;.</p> <p>It is a matter of fact that the existence of an Open Source licensed version  will limit the possibility of merchantability of alternative licences: indeed,  if a free Open Source version exists, why would users accept to pay high  licensing costs for a &ldquo;commercial-off-the-shelf&rdquo; solution? Therefore, the  additional fees requested from users in the framework of an alternative licence  are generally justified by a higher warranty and a better level of support  services.</p> <p>A number of software companies operate according to this model (for example  SUN for Star Office/Open Office or MySQL , which presents two versions - open  and proprietary - of its database).</p> <p>In the case of dual licensing, your sole potential issue will be to reduce  forking (the co-existence and competition among different software versions) by  integrating third party FLOSS contributions into the version that is licensed  differently. If the Open Source test bed demonstrates the efficiency and  profitability of a new specific module, you may find a convenient agreement with  the author (you will normally have good contacts with him as member of your  developers community) or decide to rewrite the most useful modules by yourself  (copyright protects the form, not the ideas).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-20"></a> <h2><a name="faq17"></a>Is EUPL software &ldquo;for free&rdquo;?</h2> <p>As often reminded &ldquo;free software is not for free&rdquo;, meaning that it has  certainly a cost, at least for developing, implementing, training the users and  maintaining it. In the specific case of the EUPL, the rights granted by the  licence are <strong>always</strong> royalty-free (as said in Article 2).</p> <p>This does not restrict the merchantability of additional services related to  the software, for example providing consultancy or support for implementation or  maintenance.</p> <p>Similarly the various stakeholders undertaking a common project may decide to  share investments according to a separate &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; agreement, and to ask for  a contribution in the case new participants would like to join (because they  will then benefit from the support from other members or from the contractors of  the consortium).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-21"></a> <h2><a name="faq18"></a>Are they limitations to the use of the software?</h2> <p>They are normally not: you can use the software for any purpose (for example  commercial, private or non-profit), in any place or country (inside or outside  the European Union), on any type of computer (from the mobile PC to the main  frame) and for any number of users. You may also use it to provide your services  on a network like the Internet or on your Intranet.</p> <p>The only restrictions are related to modification and re-distribution of the  software:</p> <ul>     <li>if you modify it, keep intact all existing copyright mentions and identify  your own modifications by prominent marks (who did it, when, for what purpose)  with mention of your own copyright</li>     <li>if you redistribute it, ensure that it is done under the EUPL licence, or  under a compatible licence from the list attached to the EUPL (only if this is  compulsory after merging or integrating the software with a component that is  licensed under the compatible licence).     <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p>     </li> </ul> <a name="section-22"></a> <h2><a name="faq19"></a>Can I provide government services on Internet, based on  EUPL licensed software?</h2> <p>Yes you can. Indeed, Article 2 of the EUPL provides you the right to  &ldquo;communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the  Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be,  the Work&rdquo;.</p> <p>Therefore, the deployment of the EUPL licensed software via Internet or via  any similar public network is considered as a case of &laquo;distribution&raquo; according  to the licence. This remains true even if the end-users perceive (for example  through their Internet browser) only a selection of functionalities and not the  whole software itself.</p> <p>As soon such communication of EUPL software is done, the licence covers it  (because &ndash; according to Article 10, the licence is accepted by exercising any  rights granted by Article 2). However, this means also that, if you modify or  improve some EUPL licensed software and use it to provide your services on line  to the general public, you have to make your modified source code available on a  repository, in order to allow the original author as well as other members of  the &laquo;developers community &raquo; to benefit from your contributions, as the case  could be.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-23"></a> <h2><a name="faq20"></a>Can I make my own software on EUPL software?</h2> <p>Yes, provide you respect (leave as they are) the existing copyright mentions  related to the part of EUPL licensed code that is used in your own software.</p> <p>If you decide to redistribute or to communicate to the public the resulting  work, you will have to do so under the EUPL provisions (including the  publication of your source code on a repository). Using the modified software to  provide services via Internet is considered as a &laquo; communication to the public  &raquo;.</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> <a name="section-24"></a> <h2><a name="faq21"></a>Can I merge other software with EUPL software?</h2> <p>Yes, you can merge EUPL software or any part or component of it with other  software, provide this other software is yours (developed by you or for you) or  was licensed to you under licensing terms allowing you to do so (which is the  case with all Open Source software).</p> <p>Please note that the question of how far software can be considered as  &ldquo;merged&rdquo; is a matter of case to case appreciation. Merging criteria (or criteria  to consider that a new software is a derivative) are not precisely defined in  the EUPL, because it was not reasonable, due to the diversity of possible  situations.</p> <p>In most cases, simply aggregating, combining or linking software does not  create a derivative.</p> <p>Whenever possible, it is recommended that the different components exchange  parameters or data without merging their source code into a single file. This  would preserve modularity, facilitate future improvements and prevent licence  compatibility issues in the case of re-distribution as the different components  can then be used and possibly be re-distributed under their respective different  licences.</p> <p>If it is not possible to avoid the merging of the different codes within a  single file, you will not encounter problems if you are using the merged  software for your own needs (no distribution outside your organisation).  However, if your intention is to distribute the merged software to third parties  under the EUPL licence or to perform it publicly (for example by providing a  service with it on the Internet), the pre-requisite is to check if the licensing  conditions of the merged software are compatible.</p> <p>To help you, JOINUP publishes a <a href="./eupl-compatible-open-source-licences" title="EUPL-compatible licenses" class="internal-link">list or matrix of licences that  are compatible with the EUPL</a>.</p> <p>There is no problem if you have the copyright of the other software: the  merged software is a derivative work that can be re-distributed under the  EUPL.</p> <p>There is no problem if the other software licensing conditions are permissive  regarding the re-distribution under the EUPL (this would be the case if the  merged component was licensed to you under a BSD or a MIT licence, for  example).</p> <p>At the contrary, if these licensing conditions are restrictive or &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;  (allowing no re-distribution under any other licence than the original one), you  should check if this licence is included into the EUPL compatibility list. If  this is the case (for example if the other software was licensed to you under  GPL v. 2), there are no problems either: you are authorised to re-distribute the  merged software under the compatible licence.</p> <p>In other cases no re-distribution will be possible without a specific  authorisation from all relevant authors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some authors distributing components under a &quot;copyleft&quot; licence have  implemented &quot;FOSS exception lists&quot; to authorise the distribution of larger  (combined) derivative works under another FOSS licence. For example Oracle has  included the EUPL in its FOSS exception list (for integrating MySQL components  that are distributed under the Gnu GPLv2).</p> <p align="right">[<a href="#section-0" class="external-link">top</a>]</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p>' WHERE `node_revisions`.`nid` =3051 and `node_revisions`.`vid` =3142 LIMIT 1;

Due to numerous possibilities, the Matrix does not cover all real  situations (which are not always &ldquo;clear-cut&rdquo; and where more than two  licenses could be relevant). Since European case law is generally  missing, the matrix suggests reasonable guidance without providing a  guarantee that this suggestion will always be followed by a judge, as  the case may be.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Most F/OSS incompatibilities result from copyleft conflicts&nbsp;(when  both licenses impose the reuse of the&nbsp;same license in case of  redistribution). The aim and utility of copyleft is to protect the free  software world against appropriation. In our vision, it should not make  distribution difficult or legally impossible when the work is covered by  different F/OSS copyleft licenses. In such case, because of a weak  interest, the risk of litigation is weak also, while not zero.  Therefore, the Matrix is rather &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;, based on factual license  provisions and on comments provided by license stewards. We consider  also that permission to distribute the executable binaries under a  single license solves compatibility issues (as soon distribution is  legally possible, there is no need for a single license covering the  source code). The Matrix is not influenced by ideology (telling the good  and the ugly, urging people to use or to avoid specific licenses). On  OSOR.eu user request, the OSOR team supports legal interoperability and  the prevention of litigation by kindly requesting clarification or  exceptions from the license stewards or from relevant licensors.

From the end user point of view, the application may  look like a single program (it may have a single name, unique  interface, documentation etc.). From the developer point of view, each  component is a separate program, possibly obtained under various primary  licenses.</p> <p>In case these various licenses are &ldquo;free / open source&rdquo; and  &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, what kind of linking could you implement to be legally  authorised to distribute the application, under a single license or &ndash;  possibly &ndash; under several licenses?</p> <p>There are two main cases of linking:</p> <ul>     <li>Static linking combines components through compilation, copying  them into the target application and producing a merged object file that  is a stand-alone executable.</li> </ul> <ul>     <li>Dynamic linking uses components at the time the application is loaded (load time) or during execution (run time).</li> </ul> <p>In the above Matrix, we assume that both linking are permitted in two  cases: when incorporation (merging codes in a &ldquo;cut-paste&rdquo; sense) is  authorised and when the distribution of object code under the EUPL is  authorised (because this covers static linking at object code level as  well).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div>From the legal (copyright) point of view, the question of linking  is similar to the incorporation discussion: does linking produce a  derivative of the used components, or not? <ul>     <li>If the answer is &ldquo;NO&rdquo;, each part of the application can be  licensed under its primary license: You may declare &ldquo;My application is  licensed to you under the EUPL, except component X that is licensed  under GPL, component Y that is licensed under the EPL, component Z under  the MPL etc...</li> </ul> <ul>     <li>If the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo;, the distribution of the new derivative  could be legally impossible (under any license) as soon a copyleft  conflict exists. Such prohibition may be considered as beneficial (or  protective) for the free software world in case the licensor planned to  use a proprietary license. On the contrary, the prohibition may look  cumbersome and fussy when all relevant licenses are OSI-approved  (providing the same freedoms) and copyleft (protecting against  appropriation).</li> </ul> <p>In Europe there is no case law solving this question. In absence of  case law, we have to be careful. We may assume that a judge will  interpret the copyright law with more flexibility (no derivative created  by linking) in the case of &ldquo;copyleft conflict&rdquo; between two OSI approved  licenses, and more strictly if a proprietary license is used (creation  of a derivative in such case, because in such litigation the  &quot;market-based&quot; factors are looking more important than the pure linking  technique) &ndash; but this is a pure assumption.</p> <p>The recent GPLv3 looks receptive to these &ldquo;market-based&rdquo; factors when  a compilation is not used to limit users&rsquo; freedom, at least in the  specific case of aggregates[<a href="#notes" title="Notes">3</a>]  . We estimate that the requirement that independent sources (compiled  together) should not form a larger program is to understand from  developers&rsquo; point of view: no portion of the code is copied into a  larger program (on the contrary, due to some interface layer, end users  may perceive the independent components as a single application).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead of European and US case law[<a href="#notes" title="Notes">4</a>] , we may deal with the main F/OSS opinion makers:</p> <ul>     <li>Lawrence Rosen (IP professor and OSI general counsel) says that  the method of linking is mostly irrelevant to the question about whether  a piece of software is or is not a derivative work. For him, a  derivative is made only in the case of incorporation [in a copy-paste  sense] of original code, or in the case of modification, translation or  other change in any way for creating the new program.</li> </ul> <ul>     <li>Other IP specialists believe that static linking may produce  derivative works, while dynamic linking may not, but the question is not  &ldquo;clear-cut&rdquo;. For example, some dynamically linked Linux kernel drivers  are distributed under proprietary licenses, and the Linux author (L.  Torvalds) agrees that such dynamic linking can create derived works in  specific circumstances.</li> </ul> <ul>     <li>The Free Software Foundation and their followers, in their  desire to extend the free-software world by giving it more tools than  the proprietary world, are the most assertive: static linking creates  derivatives and executables which uses a dynamically-linked library may  also be derivatives, except when separate programs just &ldquo;communicate&rdquo;  with one another [<a href="#notes" title="Notes">5</a>]  . Does this interest for &ldquo;protecting and extending free software&rdquo; still  exist when the other license is the EUPL (which is a free, copyleft  software license)? The FSF could answer positively, because - at the  contrary of the OSI - it has a strong GPL centric policy, arguing that  for protecting free software there is little salvation outside their own  GPLs (in fact, the GPLv3 and AGPLv3).</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We made the assumption that, by selecting a Gnu license, licensors  follow the FSF position and want to consider that most cases of static  linking create a derivative. A question mark (?) is resulting from the  absence of case law.

UPDATE  `node_revisions` SET `body` = '<h3>Principle 1</h3><p>Joinup and its services are exclusively reserved for the  exchange and collaboration on Open Source Software. This means that  software or projects that are not released under recognized OSS licences  will not be admitted on Joinup, or will be removed as the case may  be. The Open Source character of software is defined in the licence,  where the software author(s) or &ldquo;Licensor&rdquo; ensures a number of freedoms  to the licensee:</p><ul>    <li>Freedom to use or run it for any purpose and any number of users</li>    <li>Freedom to study how the software works. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>    <li>Freedom to share,(redistribute) copies of the softwar</li>    <li>Freedom to modify, adapt, improve the software according to  specific needs and to share (redistribute) these modifications. Access  to the source code is a precondition for this.</li></ul><p>The use of the EUPL licence, which is available in all official  European languages and was especially written for use by public sector  in Europe, comes highly recommended. However, any other licence that is  recognized by the OSI (<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>), or the FSF (<a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>) will be accepted.</p><h3>Principle 2</h3><p>Joinup is reserved for software and projects that are of  particular use for public administrations in Europe, and/or produced by  the public sector.When describing the project, the provider should  explain the link of the project with the public sector (is it owned,  sponsored, funded in research program, aimed to&hellip;) and explain why it may  be useful for other public administrations. This represents a wide  array of possible applications. The reference to public administrations  is not exclusive of other usages: for example a Geographical Information  System may be considered as &ldquo;answering to public sector needs&rdquo; (road  making etc.), even if it can also be useful for private purpose (home  building, truck or property management etc.). Joinup taxonomy will  help project owners to categorise their project according to public  sector needs.The fact that specific sectors (games, entertainment,  religion, genealogy etc.) are not present in the taxonomy may be an  indication that related projects are not targeted to answer to public  sector needs.The reference to Europe is not exclusive either: Joinup  welcomes projects that are initiated and could be downloaded and used  everywhere, provide they may be useful to public administrations in  Europe.The project owner can be a public administration, however it can  be any other person (individual, association, company) developing  software that is of particular use for public administrations.</p><h3>Principle 3</h3><p>Joinup is freely and publicly accessible . Everybody can access Joinup and contribute to hosted projects. Everybody can submit a  project. Joinup management will avoid bureaucracy. No ex-ante  authorisation will be necessary to participate. Respect of Joinup  principles will be checked ex-post by the community of Joinup users and  stakeholders.However, for the use of certain functionalities,  submitting a project or contributing to a specific project,  authentication will be required. Due to the sensitivity of certain  public sector projects, It may happen that a specific project owner will  temporarily restrict the contribution to a restricted group of  developers. This will be the decision of that specific project owner  (and not of Joinup management). When accepting to share your work  with other people, it is recommended not to restrict access more than it  is strictly necessary.</p><h3>Principle 4</h3><p>Distributing software under an open source licence, such as the EUPL  implies that the rights granted by the licence should be royalty-free.  As a consequence, all projects hosted by Joinup shall be free of  royalties. This does not restrict the optional merchantability of  additional services related to the software, for example providing  consultancy or support for implementation or maintenance. Such services  must stay optional, and may not become a condition for downloading,  using or modifying the software.</p><h3>Principle 5</h3><p>The provider must be the author, the copyright owner or have a valid  license for all that is being communicated. The provider will provide  the material in readable/revisable form using open standards and open  formats and will be responsible to publish (or link to) the licensing  terms that are applicable. This is the main guarantee that needs to be  provided to all other Joinup users, in order to avoid later  intellectual property issues.If the software to be released was entirely  written by the provider (or by the employees of the provider\'s  organisation, i.e. the legal entity that will release the software),  then the provider should normally own the exclusive copyright on the  software. In any other situation, the provider needs to check who wrote  the software (or any part of it) and under what terms (or licence, or  service contract) the provider is allowed to reproduce it in the  software and distribute it on Joinup.If the software was written  for the provider by contractors, the provider may have the right to  reuse and re-distribute it, or may even own the software exclusively -  this depends on the terms of the service contract under which the  software was written.The software should be provided in  readable/revisable form using preferably open standards or formats. If  the software is distributed as a binary package (object code), the  readable source code, or link to a repository where this source code is  available should be communicated.The licensing terms (or link to) that  are applicable to your software or to its various components should also  be published. It may happen that the &ldquo;software solution&rdquo; that is  distributed is made from several components, each of them with different  licensing conditions.</p><h3>Principle 6</h3><p>If the user downloads, uses or modifies the work that was put on the  Repository by other persons, the user should always search for, read and  adhere to the terms of the related licence.When adding contributions,  as the case may be, it is possible that own copyright marks are added,  in particular if this contribution is especially important, however,  users should never change existing copyright marks or licensing terms.</p><h3>Principle 7</h3><p>When redistributing to other persons the material found on the  Repository, users will apply the original licensing conditions if it is  requested by the provider that re-distribution under the same licensing  terms is compulsory. While all FLOSS licences authorise redistribution  of the licensed software, several licences are &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, meaning that  if a re-distribution is done, this must be under the same licensing  terms.</p><h3>Principle 8</h3><p>No one shall make a commercial use of the Joinup platform, or use it  for any kind of advertisement related to private and / or profitable  services.This rule applies even when some software that will be  available on the Repository may also or eventually be used for  commercial purposes, or generates an ecosystem of commercial services.  As a project owner or the author of a software, it is possible to inform  the Joinup users about contact details and possibly display of the  logo in appropriate format and reasonable resolution.It is permitted to  link Joinup to any other web site which may be commercial or offer  services such as the ones mentioned in Principle 4.However, it is  absolutely non permitted that any advertising material is published on  the Joinup pages (including project pages).</p><h3>Principle 9</h3><p>When facilitating the distribution of the work, Joinup is not  responsible and does not provide any guarantee related to this work. As  the project owner and the licensor, you are the sole responsible of your  work, and will comply with intellectual property rights, criminal law,  data privacy, statutory product liability and any other legal  requirement. This is self-explanatory: when opening a project, the  provider is responsible for its content. The principle of transparency  (publication of the source code, under scrutiny of a wide community)  should reinforce security and the evidence that source code contains no  malicious software, virus, etc. Joinup does not control or validate  the content of your project. The publication and distribution of a  project on Joinup is not, per se, a certification or label of  quality. They are specialised services for obtaining such certification  or label.</p><h3>Principle 10</h3><p>Users and providers should consider all requests or recommendations  from the Joinup Web master concerning the content of the work (or  &ldquo;project pages&rdquo;). This authority can also remove / put off line all  projects, pages or texts that appear &ndash; whether originally or later &ndash; to  be contrary to the Joinup principles. Joinup is not bureaucratic.  It is open to everyone, according to the present Principles. However, if  it appears even after some time, that the software or the content that  was published should be adapted to comply with those principles, the Joinup web master may request the modification or removal of the  content in question.The Joinup web master can also make the unilateral  decision to remove / put off line or set &ldquo;not visible&rdquo; any web page or  project, after notifying the project owner and justifying such decision. Joinup will not be liable for any damage in such case.</p>' WHERE `node_revisions`.`nid` =582;
