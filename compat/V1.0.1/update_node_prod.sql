Sometimes, it is related to public sector policies for the promotion of FLOSS. But there are also an increasing number of projects producing customised software for public administrations. This report looks into why FLOSS developers should collaborate with the public sector, and suggests how they should do this. </span></li>

Introducing Open Source Software communities to Europe\'s public sector</span></a></span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">: In the early 2000s the European Commission had realized the potential of open source software and its communities for the public sector. As the topic gained on importance the Commission launched the GPOSS portal, which was essentially a source of providing information regarding open source software for public administrations. Eventually the GPOSS portal was replaced by another platform, which allowed for actual cooperation of projects: OSOR.eu. This platform aimed at introducing public administrations to open source software and also to the community dynamics behind the software. It features a variety of projects and has several partnering websites, which contribute to further expanding the network.</span></li>

After experiencing a vast increase in requests for their services in 2006 and 2007, the Mapping Authority also had to deal with an increasingly overstrained IT infrastructure. The licenses for their infrastructure however were very costly, and acquiring additional licenses would only increase the financial burden consistently in the future. The Mapping Authority therefore chose to employ an IT infrastructure based on open source software solutions, which were free of licensing costs and which proved to be much better, performance wise. In the process of introducing the new IT infrastructure, the team had to build up own expertise in order to maintain a functioning system. With the help of online communities, this has been a great success for the Mapping Authority.</span></li>

The previous ICT platform was very costly and obliged the Police to stick with a hand full of vendors. The aim was therefore to cut costs, avoid vendor lock-in, achieve better performance, and introduce open standards. Before ideas were realized, a thorough study was conducted to calculate costs and benefits. This study foresaw cost savings of up to fifty percent over a five years period compared to the proprietary hardware and software in place at this time, while improving performance at the same time. Due to the dimensions of this project that affected the entire ICT infrastructure of the Swedish National Police, it was not always easy to turn ideas into reality.</span></li>

A team with different sub-tasks was formed, which investigated future learning environments and how learning material was presented and disseminated through those. Next to this, the OU also researched open learning models, as part of the OpenLearn project. The team of researchers and technical staff, after setting out the components required to meet the OU\'s needs the most appropriate match was determined. The choice fell on the VLE Moodle, which is an open source product. Today the Moodle VLE has been successfully implemented at the OU and the OU has further published a significant amount of their learning material under a Creative Commons license as courses on the Moodle VLE based OpenLearn website, which are freely available to anyone interested. The OU continues to collaborate closely with the Moodle community, as this provides a very large platform for feedback and information. All the OU\'s development is given back to the Moodle community, which improves the product for the OU and the rest of the community.</span></li>

The overall objective has been to develop a system that was easy to maintain, sustainable in the future, and free of licensing costs: the so called desktop4eduation. Although open source software is not extensively used in Austrian schools yet, it is becoming more and more important, as the government tries to promote free software over proprietary solutions increasingly. Today the desktop4education project is being frequently used as a reference case by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture and as such promoted by them throughout Austria.</span></li>

The solution had to be secure, adaptable, and fully featured. The IT direction of the city of Arles was in close contact with the open source initiative OpenMairie, which presented many software products for the use in the public sector. It was through this relationship that the four municipalities took the initiative to start OpenCimetiere, an open source management system for cemeteries. This was started with an initialization phase in 2006, followed by a contribution phase in 2007, where the software was further improved and extended. Today, the software is used by over 300 municipalities inside and outside France, and helps an increasing number of municipalities all over the world to manage their citizens\' final resting places efficiently.</span></li>

The solution was developed with open source tools, as a common effort of all seven municipalities of the Kongsberg region. Once the project was working successfully, other municipalities and organisations became interested and wanted to use the portal as well. The Kongsberg region eventually published FriKomPort, as the portal was called, as a free software application under the GPL. The portal today is used by more than 50 organisations, and practically all users are very confident about the solution. For the future the FriKomPort leaders hope to share the portal with even more municipalities by publishing an English version.</span></li>
    <li><u><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: blue">Eurostat: Standards and open source software for data interoperability: </span></u><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Eurostat collects and publishes huge amounts of data each year, and exchanges many datasets with other large organisations. This exchange was constantly suffering from a lack of interoperability, as data needed to be converted from one organisation\'s convention into another, a process which consumes both time and money. Different organisations were also using very different tools to work with the data, which caused further problems. In late 2001, Eurostat got together with a number of EU committees to discuss the need for greater interoperability within the European public sector. In 2005, IDABC agreed to fund the SDMX Open DATA Interchange (SODI) project. Thanks to previous cooperations between Eurostat and other international institutions, the SDMX standard quickly found a large group of sponsors, all of which hoped to benefit from the greater interoperability afforded by using a single standard, and the tools built on it. These tools were developed by Eurostat and other sponsoring institutions, and many of them were published under the EUPL license. The SDMX Converter is an example of the successful development and publication of a tool that is essential for working with the SDMX standard.</span></li>

While the Ministry of Agriculture has documented vineyards and crops for more than 20 years, this documentation was previously not up to EU standards. When Hungary became an EU Member State in 2004, the wine sector had to start providing standardized documentation in order to be eligible for funding under the EU\'s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). For this reason, the state-owned company F&Ouml;MI developed the national vineyard register VINGIS. It opted to base its solution on open source software in order to keep the system flexible and costs low. Although the development proved difficult, the final product is benefiting approximately 200.000 people between public bodies and wine-growers.</span></font></p>

With this also came the introduction of open source applications such as Gnome, Firefox and the Evolution mail client. Among the goals were vendor independence and the implementation of open standards. The IT solution was extended to the newly formed Swiss Federal Administrative Court in 2007, where it has struggled to find acceptance mainly due to organisational reasons.</span> </font></p>

UPDATE `node_revisions` SET `body` = '<p>The licence is the legal instrument allowing you to use, check, modify and distribute free/open source software (F/OSS or FLOSS). The European Union Public Licence (EUPL) is certainly one of the prefered licences on Joinup, but it is not the only one: you may use any other &quot;OSI approved&quot; licences (about 60 models, including the GPL, LGPL, BSD, Apache, Artistic etc.). The aim of this community is to address your questions related to F/OSS licensing and to clarify legal issues, based on questions received by the&nbsp;Joinup team.</p>
<p>Welcome to all of you!&nbsp; In order to contribute to this EUPL community, you need&nbsp;to be a registered user of Joinup. This is very easy:&nbsp;if you are not yet registered please do so by following the link <a href="../../user/register" class="external-link"><font color="#800080">here</font></a>.Then&nbsp;subscribe to the EUPL&nbsp;community by clicking on the icon on the Portlet &quot;My Community&quot;.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Community\'s genesis<strong> </strong>can be traced&nbsp;to the public forum organized by the European Commission after the disclosure of the draft EUPL v.0.1 in June 2005. &ldquo;<em>What are your views on the Licence? Have you comments on the proposed text or on the principle of a licence that is written with European legislation in mind?</em>&rdquo; Bernhard Schnittger (IDABC team) asked. This forum generated controversial opinions: strongly against the initiative, or strongly in favour of it. It has a substantial impact on the draft: 10 of the 15 articles were modified and compatibility with the GPL was implemented, producing the EUPL version 1.0 adopted by the European Commission in January 2007 in three linguistic versions (EN/FR/DE).</p>
<p>The next important milestone was the publication of the EUPL in 22 linguistic versions of equal value. All translation reviewers (two lawyers per Member State) and guest experts discussed the text in January 2008. This conference and discussions with&nbsp;OSI produced the EUPL version 1.1, which is certified by OSI since March 2009.</p>
<h3>Objective and focus</h3>
<p>The objective of the EUPL community is to maintain the focus on F/OSS licensing, especially by public sector authorities. It is to exchange opinions and experiences, to clarify issues, to explore new ideas (the previous EUPL elaboration process has demonstrated that your opinions are important and will be taken in consideration).</p>
<p>The forum is open to all (lawyers, developers, project leaders, but not exclusively). Provide the question is relevant to our focus and fairly presented, there will be no taboo: Has the EUPL its place in the &ldquo;already too many&rdquo; circle of F/OSS licences? Is maintaining 22 equivalent linguistic versions sustainable? Should the EUPL compatibility be enlarged to licence X or Y?In the blog,&nbsp;community members&nbsp;will try to provide&nbsp;each other&nbsp;information related to the EUPL and to F/OSS licensing, that may come from various sources.Last, let\'s remember that the objective of the EUPL is not to compete or to replace any existing licence: it is to&nbsp;encourage a new wave of F/OSS licensors, especially among public administrations in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OSOR.eu project started in late 2006 as part of the Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (IDABC) programme. The Commission and the Member States (MS) of the European Union realized the need to establish a &ldquo;platform for exchanging information, experiences and open source software based code for the use in public administrations&rdquo;. After all, most public administrations are facing more or less the same issues when it comes to their software needs, and creating a framework in which common interest could be discussed and efforts shared consequently should benefit all participating parties. As head of the IDABC unit Karel De Vriendt explains: &ldquo;The origin of the idea was that when open source became an issue that was occasionally raised within public administrations, one of the major problems was to have an overview of what is happening elsewhere.&rdquo; Giving an overview of the subject was especially important regarding open source software for the public sector, as traditional support and vending mechanisms did not apply to this kind of software.</p>

<p>The OSOR.eu platform, which had started as an observatory, eventually became an important meeting place for public administrations, developers, businesses and citizens alike. Today, more than 135 projects feature their software on the OSOR repository, enabling others to benefit from their developments, while benefiting themselves from the evolving communities around the products. In total one can search for approximately 2000 projects through the associated OSOR partners\' websites that are linked to the repository. As a survey conducted in early 2010 clearly shows, the OSOR user base is truly international. Although most participants originate from EU countries, there is also a substantial number of users from non-EU countries (see chart to the right).</p>

<h2>Organisation and background</h2>
<p>Behind the organisation of OSOR stands the European Commission\'s Directorate General for Informatics. The Commission in 2004 proposed the IDABC programme, which &ldquo;uses the opportunities offered by information and communication technologies to encourage and support the delivery of cross-border public sector services to citizen and enterprises in Europe, to improve efficiency and collaboration between European public administrations and to contribute to making Europe an attractive place to live, work and invest.&rdquo; (IDABC website). The Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR) being one of the activities included in the IDABC work programme, fits well into the general aim of strengthening efficiency and collaboration between public administrations.</p>
<p>Before OSOR was established in 2008 the IDABC had already focused on open source software and its benefits for the public sector. Starting with the IDA II programme, which was succeeded by the IDABC programme, the Commission had realized the need for a platform to inform MS about the use of open source by the public sector. The presumption in the early 2000s was still that if a public administration needed a custom solution, it would hire a developer that would do all of the work. The concept of sharing expertise, efforts and eventually software was still a relative new and emerging one by the time IDABC launched its GPOSS (Good Practice in Open Source Software) observatory. As the project officer of GPOSS Barbara Held explains: &ldquo;Our hypothesis was: The more they will know about it, the more they will use it.&rdquo; GPOSS as such was not a repository, where actual software could be shared and communities established, but a point of information, where licenses were explained, best practice examples presented and public administrations invited to participate in open source events.</p>
<p>In the years 2004 and 2005 public administrations slowly started to realize the benefits of common efforts. &ldquo;People started to work together. The idea of sharing became much more central&rdquo;, remembers Held. OSOR in this respect took the GPOSS idea a bit further. The intention was to create a platform that went beyond information exchange, enabling people to work together and to form communities. All the information that was available through GPOSS was transferred to OSOR and in addition to this an OSS repository added that would allow for sharing and user contributions. For Held &ldquo;The dream was that people would not only upload content and other users download this content, but that actual communities would grow, where people would work together on a European level.&rdquo; Starting with about 35 projects in the repository, which quickly found appreciation throughout Europe, the project grew quickly.</p>
<p>Behind OSOR there are a number of people making sure that the content and the maintenance of the platform is of high quality and updated continuously, as well as promoting and disseminating it amongst its target audiences. With regard to the content creation and the technical aspects of maintaining the platform, amongst other aspects, a consortium led by Unisys is in charge for OSOR and assures that the project delivers the expected results.</p>

<h2>Budget and Funding</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OSOR project is funded by the European Commission, with a budget of roughly &euro; 3.2 million, which covers the entire project period from late 2006 until mid 2010. For the development, maintenance and further development of the technical platform the total cost will be at &euro; 1.4 million by Q3 of 2010. For the content creation and stakeholder management the project has a budget of roughly &euro; 1.8 million.</p>
<p>Beside the costs of the project, another point that one might raise is the possible savings that are generated through the shared development and use of the projects on the OSOR repository. Although the OSOR team has not done an investigation as to how much those savings might be as this would be an impossible task within the available resources, the impact may quite possibly be very high. To illustrate this, one might look at SEXTANTE, which is a geographic information system (GIS) software. The cost to develop the software, in terms of time needed to develop the 101.936 lines of code would amount to roughly &euro; 2.5 million(For sloccount calculations, please visit <a class="external-link" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount">http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount</a> ). On the one hand, one can assume that this cost has been shared amongst various public administrations that contributed to the development, but one may also assume that the number of people that benefited from actually using the software is substantially higher than the number of developers and contributors. Even in the case that only one percent of the 65.000 times that the software has been downloaded would actually lead to an deployment of the software would mean that 650 public administrations saved up to &euro;2.5 million, by not having to develop the software themselves. Based on the Gartner survey, the actual re-use of software is much higher at around 30%, indicating that the number of administrations that benefit from the software projects is much higher than the rather pessimistic example above. To mitigate this number to some extend, one clearly has to see that SEXTANTE is not purely a custom software and there might be other solutions that can handle similar tasks for a much smaller price tag (i.e. for the use of ESRI ArcGIS, one does not have to pay the complete development costs of the software). It is nonetheless safe to assume that through the reuse and redevelopment of the software hosted on OSOR, public administrations or other stakeholders potentially could save substantial amounts of public money.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing this case study OSOR users have been invited to participate in a survey, which is intended to give the OSOR team important feedback. The problem with download statistics is often that a download does not necessarily correlate with an actual installation of software at a public administration. It is therefore very hard for the OSOR team to understand the impact of the project and to provide concrete numbers about re-use of software. It is presumed that the survey will give a first insight with regard to the impact of the project and its reach throughout public administrations across Europe.</p>
<a name="section-3"></a>
<h2>Technical issues</h2>
<p>When the OSOR website was launched in early summer 2008, the team had every intention of sticking to a stack of free and open source software without making too many adaptations themselves. &ldquo;The basic principle was that we use software that anyone can take and we make this website with standard software that we change as little as possible&rdquo;, explains Held. Large parts of the website are build with PLONE, which is a free and open source content management system (CMS). While offering many features and being easy to manage, PLONE further has an excellent security record, which clearly was an important aspect to consider.</p>
<p>Although the team behind OSOR had to tweak the system and learn how to use it properly at first, there were no major problems over the years. Issues such as a problem with attributing the right names to authors were quickly solved, and even one hack attack could be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the content from GPOSS was moved to OSOR in order to have one platform only that would entail all the information acquired over the years. The case studies, the news, the events, among other points, all contributed to making OSOR a website that was both interesting and relevant for the public sector from the start. The \'Forge\' or repository that was newly introduced on OSOR might be seen as the most innovative part of the website, as it was the first of its kind for public administrations at a European level. Initially 34 projects participated, but the number quickly rose to 135 today. &ldquo;But altogether almost 2000 projects are searchable and downloadable through the OSOR site and the partner national forges&rdquo; highlights OSOR project manager Szabolcs Szekacs.</p>
<a name="section-4"></a>
<h2>Licensing of Open Source Software</h2>
<p>Licensing has always been an important issue for open source software. After all, it is important to give clear instructions as to how a software may be used, how it may be distributed and altered to name just a few aspects. Furthermore this is especially important for public administrations that plan to release their development as open source software, since they might want to make sure that the software and the work they invested will not be sold by third parties, but instead be of use to other public administration facing the same issues. &ldquo;Especially for public administrations it can take very long to decide for a license for a software&rdquo;, states Szekacs.</p>
<p>Through their legal council OSOR provides projects that are planning to release their software under an OSS license with the opportunity to receive legal advice regarding the choice of license. &ldquo;We have done a lot of work explaining how open source works, and how licensing works&rdquo;, states De Vriendt. On the one hand there are guidelines on the website on how to use OSS licenses, which give a good overview of the different aspects that have to be considered. And on the other hand OSOR also has contracted a person that is able to provide specific answers to cases that need more consultation. Although most projects decide for a license without consulting OSOR, there were several occasions &ldquo;where this was a problem, and where they wanted some help&rdquo;, explains Szekacs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately from time to time there are still &ldquo;grave errors being made&rdquo;, which are mostly a result of a &ldquo;lack of knowledge&rdquo;, explains De Vriendt. On very few occasions, projects just uploaded their content without any license at all. To prevent this from happening the \'10 principles of using OSOR\' have been established, which give clear instructions that any software uploaded to OSOR has to be under an open source software license.</p>
<p>Szekacs mentions the project initiated by the Municipality of Munich, WollMux, as a good example of how finding the right license is very helpful for a public administration to publish their project. As the city needed some legal basis before they wanted to make their custom OpenOffice.org template tool publicly available, they thought of several open source licenses. Eventually they realized that the European Union Public License (EUPL) was the right choice due to its legal implications and also because it was supported by the European Union. Florian Schlie&szlig;l from the WollMux project explains: &ldquo;[...] in our opinion this GPL-like license minimizes the legal risks for public administrations publishing software as free software. We are pleased to use a license adapted to European law and knowing a large public body like the European Commission is behind the licence.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Project dissemination and user feedback</h2>
<p>Over the years, the Commission has provided information about OSOR at many conferences and events relevant to the public sector. Informing public administration about OSOR was and still is particularly important, as many stakeholders are still not aware of the potential advantages of using open source software and participating in open source communities, instead of purchasing proprietary solutions or developing non-reusable customized solutions. Both Held and Szekacs agree that speaking at conferences and creating awareness in this regard is very helpful. Szekacs further notices that by now OSOR is an established name in the open source community. However, as most people working at public administrations are not software developers but administrators it is even more important to speak to those who &ldquo;aren\'t yet aware&rdquo;. There are still many public administrations throughout Europe that have little or no knowledge about open source software and how it can be particularly useful for the public sector. To address this problem Szekacs sees two necessary steps. First, it is important to raise awareness for OSS in the higher levels of governments, such as the institutions of the European Union. Although already considerable awareness exists at these levels, members of the Parliament, for example, are ultimately important information and knowledge broker that could disseminate OSS knowledge in their home MS. Next to this top-down approach, Szekacs considers it helpful to investigate if it would make an impact to organise events together with the governments where those in public administrations who decide about the acquisition and/or development of software are invited. This is a very long process that may not be very rewarding at first, but at least it might make sense to &ldquo;plant the seed&rdquo;, as he says.</p>
<p>The feedback that the OSOR team gets from the active OSS users in most cases is positive. Through various conferences and public events, but as well through the communities on OSOR, it has become clear that the project is valued and does have an impact.</p>
<p>The projects that are hosted on OSOR and their communities are another important source of feedback. As projects are not obliged to report to the website about their contact with the community and their users, this form of feedback possibly bypasses the team at IDABC. Eventually the platform is not only a service to those that want to participate in a community and download useful software applications, but also for those that want to extend the reach of their developments and build a community around them. As Victor Olaya who is in charge of Sextante explains: &ldquo;We get a lot of feedback from users, either directly via email or through the backtracking system.&rdquo; The GIS software Sextante, which is a system developed for the forrest management department of the region of Extremadura, Spain, enables its users to map out landscapes and generally manage geographic areas by attributing certain characteristics to specific areas. Olaya on average gets around 15 emails per week, with questions for more functionality or information about problems with their GIS software. For Sextante this is a very important aspect of the community. &ldquo;We have many users that test the software and send us bugs, or sometimes suggestions for improvement.&rdquo; And he furthers adds &ldquo;It is a very active project.&rdquo; It is difficult for him to say exactly how many public administrations or other bodies use the software, but he and his colleague Juan Carlos Gim&eacute;nez frequently visit conferences and talk to various administrations. This way they understand that their software in fact finds many users. Although Olaya assumes that the software is being used &ldquo;world wide, or at least at a Europe-wide&rdquo;, he knows of roughly twenty public administrations and several private companies that use the software.</p>
<p>The Municipality of Munich shares this experience for their self-developed WollMux template tool. Since its publication in 2008, the tool has been downloaded more than 30.000 times from the OSOR forge. Although the situation here is the same as far as backtracking the actual deployments of the tool in public administrations goes, but the city is very content with the community that is evolving behind the product. The &ldquo;collaborative testing is great&rdquo;, explains Schlie&szlig;l, as it helps to &ldquo;improve the overall performance of this tool&rdquo;. Furthermore, the &ldquo;non-technical aspects of OSOR&rdquo; are of great importance for the WollMux team: &ldquo;Especially personal meetings and community building roadshows are a platform for us to advertise the WollMux&rdquo;, highlights Schlie&szlig;l.</p>
<a name="section-6"></a>
<h2>The open source mechanism</h2>
<p>To support government services throughout Europe and to allow them to benefit from open source software is one of the main goals of OSOR. Anyone participating in the communities or simply acquiring information from the website can get ideas of how open source software could work at his or her institution. By offering a framework in which public administrations can work together and share their experiences, OSOR brings together an international framework of people that can make their project visible beyond their communities.</p>
<p>For the project FriKomPort the participation in OSOR has been very fruitful . After being featured on OSOR, the project received many requests from various other communities about their course and seminar management tool that was developed using open source software and released under GPL license. The project\'s popularity, which was initially restricted to the Norwegian region of Kongsberg, suddenly attracted a large audience and received a lot of recognition. It won the country\'s first Open Source Software Municipality award in October 2009, as well as the Editor\'s Choice award of the website www.epractice.eu. Furthermore it was presented at the IDABC event at the Open World Forum in Paris in October 2009. Through OSOR, the project has reached many people, even beyond Europe, which might not have heard from the project at all otherwise. The project can be found at the project section on OSOR.eu(<a href="http://www.osor.eu/projects/frikomport),while">http://www.osor.eu/projects/frikomport),while</a> the actual code is available for download from frikomport.no, where developers and anyone who wants to get involved can participate.</p>

    <dd class="image-caption" style="width: 399px"><br />
    The project Sextante has been very successful with over 60.000 downloads from the project website. For the project OSOR initially was very helpful, as it offered a SVN server where the team could upload their code and share it with others. Through this, the project automatically reached out to a large number of potential users especially from other public administrations. &ldquo;So far it has helped us quite a bit&rdquo;, explains Olaya. &ldquo;The administrations know OSOR and they use it. They can go to the website and search for software. Through this mechanism OSOR has helped us in establishing contacts with administrations and other groups that need our software.&rdquo; </dd>
</dl>
<a name="section-7"></a>
<h2>Cooperation with other communities and platforms</h2>
<p>OSOR is partnering with a large number of other portals and forges. This is an important aspect of the website, as it brings OSOR in contact with various other initiatives beyond the realm of OSOR. Most of the partnering platforms and organisations offer similar services as OSOR, however mostly on a national level. In this respect, OSOR can also be seen as the link between several national communities, which makes it easier for them to connect and find each other. On OSOR alone, there are currently 134 projects where anyone can participate or simply download. Through the network of national forges there are almost 2000 projects, all of which can be reached through OSOR. The national forges are all promoted on OSOR and through the machine translation service of the European Commission all project descriptions are searchable in English. This helps fundamentally in extending the national forges outreach and connects them with a potentially much larger user group.</p>
<p>The national forges featured on OSOR include at the moment:</p>

Although there are no contractual obligation between those platforms, it is this kind of informal cooperation that helps platforms extending their outreach. After all, it is not about competing with each other, but about sharing the benefits of common developments.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<a name="section-9"></a>
<h3>Achievements / Lessons learned</h3>
<p>A problem in many public administration is often that &ldquo;nobody wants to be the first&rdquo;, explains Szekacs. The OSOR platform, which succeeded GPOSS, in this regard made a substantial contribution to open source in the public sector, by showing public administrations throughout Europe that they are in fact not the first and that others have done &ldquo;it&rdquo; before successfully. Furthermore &ldquo;we have the big advantage that we are the European Commission&rdquo; De Vriendt points out, considering that the institution has a lot of credibility. Many administrations are critical towards the open source mechanisms of working together with a community or of sharing software and the fact that the European Commission supports many of such initiatives has the potential to mitigate potential fears.</p>
<p>As the recent survey by Gartner, Inc. shows that roughly 50% of OSOR users visit the platform &ldquo;to keep up to date [as part of my expertise]&rdquo;. Only 28% of the people that participated in the survey state that &ldquo;Developing Open Source software is (part of)&rdquo; they daily work, which indicates that the platform finds wider audiences mainly those that develop software on a daily basis. 13% of all participants visit OSOR our of self interest in the topic.</p>

    <dd class="image-caption" style="width: 400px"><br />
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>Amongst most participants in the study the platform is very satisfying and the large majority of users (58%) &ldquo;can be seen as ambassadors&rdquo;, as the study highlights.</p>
<p>Has OSOR been successful from today\'s point of view? The success of initiative such as OSOR is difficult to measure, and one has to see that there are no clear &ldquo;sales targets&rdquo;, as De Vriendt puts it. In terms of software being used, shared and modified in cooperation OSOR however could be seen as a success. Initially &ldquo;our main goal was to check if something like this would be viable&rdquo; De Vriendt further states. &ldquo;And I believe yes it is viable.&rdquo; The community behind OSOR is growing, and many of the projects featured on OSOR benefit from working together with a community of other public administrations.</p>
<p>According to Szekacs, there are several aspects, which can contribute greatly to the success of a platform such as OSOR. On the one hand it is necessary to have a good team of experts involved from the start, to be able to assist others and to establish a platform that offers relevant information to public administrations. Next to this it is absolutely important to have stakeholder involvement early in the project. Considering that a community like OSOR lives from its participants, active participation and involvement are essential for the success of a platform. Having an active community, where most people not only download but also contribute content and generate discussion is therefore one of the aspects that will have to improve in the future. According to Szekacs OSOR indeed has faced quite some challenges in &ldquo;launching active, vivid communities on OSOR.eu&rdquo;, which is one of the main points where the team would like to show improvement in the future.</p>

<h3>Future plans</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We have started something, and we have positive feedback from the MS as well as from the users, but there\'s still a lot ahead&rdquo; states Szekacs. According to the Gartner survey, the news section as well as information concerning events and conferences are perceived as the best functionality of the OSOR platform. The functionalities that are considered relatively less useful are the uploading function for Open Source project and the tools collaboration tools for developments of projects. For Schlie&szlig;l, especially the last point is one main drawback: &ldquo;We do not use the limited features for source code sharing via version control systems. The offered solutions CVS and SVN are outdated and not the best choice for collaborative developments.&rdquo; For the OSOR team, more attention will have to be payed to those functionalities that are considered less useful.</p>
<p>Another important question is in which direction OSOR will go regarding the dimensions of the repository and the impact it should have. &ldquo;I always have the feeling we could do better&rdquo;, says Szekacs. Comparing to large repositories such as SourceForge, where hundreds of thousand projects are featured, OSOR is a very small project also because of its orientation towards public administrations. Due to its specific focus, this will most likely always be the case. As mentioned earlier, OSOR does not want to compete with other platforms, but offer a framework specifically for public administrations. For public administrations it is important not to face a jungle of irrelevant software applications before they find the right solutions for their specific needs. De Vriendt adds &ldquo;It\'s not about having as many projects as possible, it\'s about having good software.&rdquo; Finding a way to attract larger numbers of projects to participate in OSOR, possibly through informal cooperation with non-European platforms, while managing to keep a balance between quantity and quality will be one of the points the IDABC will address in the near future.</p>
<p>For this it will also be important to encourage and engage with the users and projects that are already a part of the OSOR community. To address this issue of lacking stakeholder involvement, Szekacs thinks of two possible starting points: &ldquo;There may be some part of the problem which can be solved by providing better technical support, such as notification features, but in order to increase the activity of communities we will need to rethink our strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Generally OSOR wants to contribute to changing the image of open source software and its working mechanisms for the better. Many public administrations are still not convinced or aware of the advantages that open source can have for their organisation. &ldquo;We must come to a situation where we can demonstrate that working together and sharing the results of that work is an effective and efficient way to establish public services&rdquo;, says De Vriendt. To achieve this OSOR will have to concentrate more on disseminating the project, and emphasise the community creation aspects, which are essential for an open source environment.</p>
<a name="section-11"></a>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>OSOR reflects well, how the European Commission and the European Member States have realised the potential of changing attitudes in software development. Where in the early 2000s public administrations were still very much focused on developing a product by themselves and for themselves, this is slowly changing towards the notion of sharing and cooperating. OSOR in this regard takes an important position, showing public administrations throughout Europe that they are indeed not the first to consider open source software and community participation for their software needs. The success stories, of which there are many, clearly illustrate that old pattern of thinking might be revised, as free and open source software has the potential to provide more freedom, more custom functionality, while often being more economic in financial terms. It is nevertheless important for OSOR to focus stronger on active community building amongst public administrations, as this appears to be the main shortcoming of the project.</p>
<p>In the future, one will have to see if the demand for open source solutions and the acceptance of open source working mechanisms will continue to grow in the public sector. OSOR certainly has the potential to take a central position, linking various national initiatives and bringing open source in public administrations on agendas of decision makers throughout Europe.</p>

UPDATE `node_revisions` SET `body` = '<p><span id="parent-fieldname-description">In 2006 the Swedish National Police launched a project that led to the implementation and migration from an ICT infrastructure based on proprietary products to an ICT server and database platform based on Open Source software and open standards. The previous ICT platform was very costly and obliged the Police to stick with a hand full of vendors. The aim was therefore to cut costs, avoid vendor lock-in, achieve better performance, and introduce open standards. Before ideas were realized, a thorough study was conducted to calculate costs and benefits. This study foresaw cost savings of up to fifty percent over a five years period compared to the proprietary hardware and software in place at this time, while improving performance at the same time. Due to the dimensions of this project that affected the entire ICT infrastructure of the Swedish National Police, it was not always easy to turn ideas into reality. </span></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In Sweden, the Swedish National Police Board (SNPB) maintains the IT infrastructure for the Swedish National Police. It is in this board that all decisions are centrally made regarding administrative issues concerning police authorities throughout the country.</p>
<p>Around the year 2000, the former director of Development and Strategies and his team at the National Police Board, investigated new possibilities for a more economic and&nbsp; flexible IT infrastructure. Per-Ola Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd, who is today executive IT-Strategist at the CIO\'s office, went to several conferences and eventually realized that &ldquo;we must have an IT architecture which is not locked to a special vendor.&rdquo; As the old architecture was comprised solely of proprietary solutions, the Swedish Police was dependent on specific vendors for the support, which in turn added high support costs to the already substantial licensing costs.</p>
<p>In the following years the Police weighed their options searching for solutions that minimized costs, introduced open standards, increased the freedom of choice of technology, enhanced the competition between vendors, and minimized the dependency on one vendor. Eventually the team in charge of this process established a business case study in early 2006, which concluded that only Open Source Software (OSS) would meet their demands. After the the National Police Commissioner decided for the deployment of OSS in November 2007, the CIO\'s office started the process of implementing the new ICT architecture. In the two years since the start of the project the CIO\'s office is still positive about the success of the project, however they also have come to realize that it takes a lot of work to make a business plan become reality.</p>

<h2>Organisation and background</h2>
<p>The Swedish National Police Board is the central organisation in the Swedish national police system. It stands above the 21 police authorities and the national laboratory of forensic science. As such, it is in charge of managing the national police budget, and comprises all important offices for the organisation of the national police services. For example, decisions on the number of helicopter or police cars purchases are made in this body, just as decision with regard to the ICT architecture. The Swedish National Police consists of roughly 27.000 employees, 19.000 of which are police officers.</p>

<p>The chief information officer (CIO) Ola &Ouml;hlund is in charge of making all relevant decisions concerning the National Police ICT infrastructure backbone. The CIO\'s office is directly connected to the SNPB and consists of seven staff members, who have a strong technical background and&nbsp; ensure the Police has a reliable and efficient ICT system. The office is still relatively new, as it had only gained the status as a more or less autonomous office within the SNPB about three years ago. Roughly 600 employees work in the Police ICT department, which is part of the business development organisation carrying out the decisions that are made by the CIO.</p>
<p><a name="section-2"></a></p>
<h2>Budget and Funding</h2>
<p>The annual IT-budget for the Swedish National Police is &euro;130 million, which is administered by the CIO office. Clearly not all of this budget is dedicated to the implementation of the new ICT architecture, but also comprises various software licenses as well as hardware purchases that the Police has to do over the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between 2001 and 2006 we used proprietary products, because an open source environment was not so common in the beginning. So we tried proprietary products, but we realized in 2006 that it was too expensive to go on with that&rdquo;, remembers Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd. From the servers to the databases, the CIO office calculated that the costs of continuing to employ the proprietary solution would amount to &euro;40 million for licenses, server hardware and support over the years from 2006 to 2011. At the same time, the team also made calculations for the costs of Open Source Software and X86 server hardware. They concluded that due to the competition between support partners for Open Source products, the prices were considerably lower than comparable support for proprietary solutions. Additionally, there were also large savings resulting from using open licenses and moving to X86 server hardware instead of proprietary hardware. Eventually the team estimated the cost for employing the new ICT platform for the same period to be only &euro;21 million, which was nearly 50% cheaper than the proprietary counterpart. To illustrate the impact of this amount, Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd says it is equivalent to 400 new police cars, or the salary of 70 new system developers for a five year period.</p>
<p>The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of using Open Source vendors instead of proprietary vendors has thus been reduced substantially. In a presentation about the Swedish National Police (See Links section) Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd highlights that the cost for the application server amount to only one fifth (1/5) of the previous solutions, and the cost for the database only one seventh (1/7) of the price of the proprietary solution.</p>
<p>Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd emphasises that the use of standard X86 server hardware was another factor for cost reduction. &ldquo;If you switch to Open Source Software, you must also switch to simple, standard X86 server hardware, because the competition there is much stronger and you have the possibility to negotiate with hardware vendors.&rdquo; Compared to non-standardised hardware products sold only by selected companies, using standard hardware makes it possible to select the best offer for hardware and support.</p>

<h2>Technical issues</h2>
<dl class="image-left captioned">
    <dt><img title="Swedish National Police 1 new" alt="Swedish National Police 1 new" width="320" height="130" src="../../system/files/images/image_preview.jpeg" /> </dt>
    <dd class="image-caption" style="width: 320px">&copy; Swedish National Police, 2009 </dd>
</dl>
<p>The SNPB\'s move towards an open ICT server infrastructure went along with a change of suppliers representing a much larger number of potential suppliers for the adapted Open Source solutions than has been the case for the replaced&nbsp; commercial products. Such a diverse range of potential suppliers has been one of the key aspects for the SNPB to avoid a vendor lock-in and to allow for competition.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the software and hardware migration only took place on the servers in the data centres, and not at the client computers. For the local police officers distributed across the country everything remained the same, and nothing new had to be learned. Even more so, the desktop PCs at the Swedish Police are still running on a proprietary operating system. Essentially the implementation of Open Source Software can therefore be considered a background migration of which only performance enhancements are felt on the desktop computer.</p>
<p>The migration project has been focusing on the replacement of four essential parts of the infrastructure: 1) the application server, 2) the database, 3) the operating system of the servers, and 4) the CPUs thereof.</p>
<p>The application servers in the previous architecture were BEA WebLogic Server 8.1. Although the application server did everything the Police needed at the time, they could already see that it had some performance limits. More importantly, it was very costly, which was not sustainable in the long run, especially in the light ofmore economic solutions that would offer at the same time more capacities. The CIO office therefore decided to employ the JBoss EAP application server. The solution only costs a fifth of the price of BEA, and was much improved in terms of performance. The same holds for the database and the operating system running on the servers. The database MySQL replaced the previously deployed Oracle, and Linux SLES by Novell replaced the operating system HP Unix on the servers. This combination, together with the new standard X86-based ICT hardware which the Police installed, gave a clear boost in performance and stability.</p>
<dl class="image-right captioned">
    <dt><img title="Swedish National Police 2" alt="Swedish National Police 2" width="308" height="240" src="../../system/files/images/image_preview_tab.png" /> </dt>
    <dd class="image-caption" style="width: 308px">Cost comparison between the previous proprietary ICT solution and the new Open Source solution&lt;br /&gt; &copy;Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd, 2009 </dd>
</dl>
<p>To prove this, the CIO\'s office has conducted a benchmark test with their in-house developed PICTURE software. This software is used by police officers to search and store passport pictures and other photo material. Although there are on average about 3,500 daily passport picture queries, this number can occasionally peak substantially higher. Whereas BEA only could cope with a maximum of 100.000 queries before the system slowed down considerably or would no longer work at all, the new architecture can cope with a number ten times higher, namely: 1.000.000 queries. The reason for this is that the new server and database environment takes up much less system resources than the previous system, which at the end boosts performance dramatically. The improved performance is therefore mostly due to the lightweight software, and not necessarily linked to a new hardware environment. Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd sums up &ldquo;So if you switch to an Open Source system it may not just be for the cost aspects, it can be for performance also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another advantage of working with an Open Source environment is the fact that it is much easier to find developers and support for the solutions, because one can choose between many vendors and the number of people developing in Open Source environments is constantly rising. Considering that about 70% of the Swedish National Police\'s ICT system is developed in-house, the importance of this quickly becomes evident. &ldquo;If you speak with any developer and ask if he wants to use BEA, Oracle, or if he wants to use JBoss, the answer is always JBoss&rdquo;, explains Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd. Finding competent developers and system administrators and building in-house expertise in this regard is very important, as proprietary vendors can only support their own solution. So if there is a problem with an in-house developed application it may take weeks to get support, or it may not be possible at all, unless there is someone employed at the Police who can take care of the problem. With the implementation of the Open Source environment the CIO also invested &euro;126.000 in staff education for JBoss, MySQL, and Linux SLES to make sure that the competence is always available in house. Here again, the CIO\'s office saw the spending in relation to the savings generated from the implementation: &ldquo;It\'s not a lot of money if you think of what you can save&rdquo;, as Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd&nbsp; compares the building of own competence together with professional open source support if you compare it with traditional commercial support on proprietary solutions.</p>
<p><a name="section-4"></a></p>
<h2>Change management</h2>
<p>Before the integration of the new software and hardware into the ICT environment of the Swedish Police, several steps were necessary to make sure that the whole process was implemented carefully.</p>
<p>Initially, a team of staff members from the ICT department realized that the ICT environment at the Police would have to change. They were &ldquo;fed up with the high costs and the vendor lock-in&rdquo; states &Ouml;hlund. Responding to these impulses, a team of IT specialists surrounding Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd started the investigation of a business case study about the migration towards an Open Source ICT architecture. This study was finished in October 2006, and became an important document, as it was the first step in the project. On the one hand it made people realize the benefits of using an Open Source Software environment and standard hardware, and it also thoroughly researched what solution would have to be employed. Following this preliminary study, the National Police Commissioner formally made the decision to implement the new ICT infrastructure in November 2006.</p>
<p>The project was divided in two steps: the implementation project, and the migration project. This division gave the project more structure, as the both sub-projects are rather substantial projects on their own.</p>
<dl class="image-right captioned">
    <dt><img title="Swedish National Police 3" alt="Swedish National Police 3" width="124" height="185" src="../../system/files/images/image_preview_smb.jpeg" /> </dt>
    <dd class="image-caption" style="width: 124px">Ola &Ouml;hlund, Chief Information Officer at the Swedish National Police Board &copy; Swedish National Police, 2009 </dd>
</dl>
<p>The implementation project started in March 2007. New X86 standard hardware was bought, together with support and maintenance for the data servers. &ldquo;We bought around 300 CPUs, and maintenance for the database MySQL [for around 120 CPUs]. We also bought support for the Linux operating system for about 300 CPUs, as well as support for around 130 JBoss application servers&rdquo; recalls Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd. This aspect of the project however was still relatively easy, considering that nothing from the old infrastructure was touched at this point. The difficult part at this stage was to find the right solutions and to install them so they would function properly. As the team had already acquired a certain level of expertise and most decisions were well planned, the process of implementing new software and hardware solutions was relatively uncomplicated.</p>
<p>After finished the implementation project in December 2007, the migration project started in April 2009 and was just as large, if not even larger as the implementation project. As part of this sub-project, 33 legacy systems will eventually be migrated to the new ICT platform, which is planned to be completed in two years until 2011. The big challenge&nbsp; in this project is ensuring that the existing ICT infrastructure works properly with the new ICT environment. According to &Ouml;hlund this process of migrating existing applications to the new infrastructure is not always easy. In contrast to the business case, the CIO is a sees this timeline with less optimism and states a slightly different aim for the completion of the whole project: &ldquo;somewhere in 2015 we will have realized all the benefits.&rdquo; For &Ouml;hlund it was important to have a good business case study before the project started, as this laid a good foundation and convinced other people at the Swedish National Police Board of the advantages of such an ICT infrastructure. In practical terms however, he sees that realizing the plan is a different challenge, to which the CIO office is dedicating many resources at the moment. On the one hand there is&nbsp; resistance due to the high costs of such an undertaking. Especially when there is a delay in the implementation and migration of software and hardware solutions, this can become a barrier to the project. And on the other hand, one needs to convince people that such an undertaking is in fact a necessary step, and that the old infrastructure should be replaced. There are thus several aspects that can impose barriers to the success of a project. To put it in &Ouml;hlund\'s words : &ldquo;The change itself is the main obstacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to cope with these obstacles, the CIO office had to work on two fronts: on the one hand it was necessary to talk to people and convince them of the advantages of the new ICT infrastructure, and on the other hand they had to find the right solutions, build up expertise, and implement and migrate the solutions. It this regard it certainly helped that the team did not rush into the project, but planned every step carefully. Only by introducing and migrating new software and hardware step by step, the team could avoid problems on a larger scale, which would have sparked new criticism. The fact that old software and hardware can run simultaneously with the new solutions without much difficulties clearly is of help as well. For &Ouml;hlund to be successful with such an initiative it is important to integrate it as part of a larger organisational strategy. &ldquo;It is not a standalone issue that you try to push forward, rather [&hellip;] it is a part of an IT strategy and a business strategy&rdquo;, he explains. By disseminating the project in this way, the acceptance at all levels is much higher, and people are much less reluctant to accept initial costs and migration processes.</p>
<p>From a financial point of view, although a delay in project completion does invoke additional costs, the team is still confident of its benefits. As there is no dedicated budget to the project, but it is covered under the general CIO budget, the process will not be stopped once the financial resources are exhausted. The CIO office is still convinced of the financial benefits that the undertaking will bring eventually. Although a large share of the ICT budget of the Swedish Police currently flows into the project, the team is aware that in the future this flow of money would have been greater had they continued to use a proprietary platform.</p>
<p><a name="section-5"></a></p>
<h2>Cooperation with other public bodies</h2>
<p>Although the Swedish government is trying to promote the use of Open Source Software in the public sector, there are not too many examples where Open Source is used on a similar scale as by the Swedish National Police. According to &Ouml;hlund and Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd, there are many public bodies that use Open Source applications in their daily operations on a small scale, but the introduction of an Open Source server and database environment on the scale of the Swedish National Police is unique in Sweden. As a result of this, the team did not have many partners to consult. The team had some conversations with Premiepensionsmyndighetens (PPM) which manages the national premium pension system, and which also migrated its ICT to an Open Source environment. There was however no direct cooperation.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there were two important reasons why the Police did not ask for help from other organisations: One the one hand it was essential for the Police to develop own expertise, in order to understand the system thoroughly. The fact that only few organisations had done a similar undertakings was seen as an opportunity to develop the knowledge and expertise in house, which is of fundamental help for the maintenance of the system. On the other hand it was important for the Police to have a Swedish language environment as well as support for their ICT infrastructure. This excluded many projects outside of Sweden as possible partners for coordination.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p><a name="section-7"></a></p>
<h3>Achievements / Lessons learned</h3>
<p>For the Swedish National Police, the introduction of Open Source software and standard X86-based server hardware to their ICT infrastructure, has many advantages. The most important aspects in this respect are: cost savings, limitation of the vendor lock-in, and the use of open standards. Considering that the Police is planning on saving roughly &euro;20 million over a period of five years, the financial incentive to turn to Open Source Software and standard X86-based server hardware was high, especially considering the fact the solution is not inferior to the proprietary solution that was previously used.</p>
<p>For the project team, it was very important to prepare a good roadmap ahead of the migration project. This helped in setting clear targets with regard to timelines and technical solutions. As this is often the case in other project involving a large-scale migration, convincing the people in charge of an organisation is never easy. In order to manage this &ldquo;soft migration&rdquo; successfully, as &Ouml;hlund calls it, communication of the advantages of a new system and disadvantages of the old system is very important. The business case study in this respect was also of great help in convincing the Swedish National Police Board that this migration step was a viable alternative.</p>
<p>While having a clear strategy is of great help to such a project, &Ouml;hlund also states that it is not always easy to make theory reality. Moving from a proprietary software environment to a consolidated Open Source Software environment with standard X86-based server hardware is a very big undertaking that should not be underestimated. &ldquo;That\'s the tough part, actually getting things done. And I think we might have some good insights to share with others&rdquo;, &Ouml;hlund furthers says. After all, there are not many other organisations that undertook such a large scale project for the sake of avoiding the vendor lock-in and reducing costs.</p>
<p>For Sj&ouml;sw&auml;rd it is furthermore important to not only focus on software, but to include hardware in a such an undertaking in order to fully benefit from it: &ldquo;[...] If you switch out the infrastructure from proprietary hardware and proprietary software to common hardware based on X86 products and Open Source Software, you will decrease [the costs] between 50% and 70% over the course of three years&rdquo;. And he further highlights that this is not only true for the public sector, but for the private sector just as much: &ldquo;Open Source can be a door opener for private companies as well. This is another twist to the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="section-8"></a></p>
<h3>Future plans</h3>
<p>The team at the national Police is hoping to complete the migration project for 33 legacy systems to the new Open Source ICT platform in a timely manner. As the business case laid out a rather optimistic target, the team is trying its best to complete the migration&nbsp; by 2011, as &Ouml;hlund explains.</p>
<p>Although the team is not actively engaged in a desktop migration at this point, the team is thinking about models how to employ free software in the desktop environment of the Swedish National Police. There are however no concrete plans yet.</p>
<p><a name="section-9"></a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The case of the Swedish National Police is a good example of how a public institution can avoid the dependence on particular hardware and software vendors, and how this has the potential to increase performance.</p>
<p>As public bodies throughout Europe are seeking to reduce costs and to maximize the value of their ICT infrastructure, the number of institutions that has realized the potential of Open Source Software is still relatively small. In this sense, the Swedish National Police can still be considered a pioneer. It was for this reason all the more important that the implementation process was well planned and carefully executed, in order to avoid drawbacks that only undermine&nbsp; the resistance to change. Although the process of implementing a new ICT infrastructure takes time and money, the Police managed to calculate the costs as well as the benefits accordingly. The project plan in this respect might have been slightly optimistic in this regard, but the project team is still convinced of the benefits the migration will bring eventually. Considering savings of up to fifty percent within the coming years, the Police has managed to plan a system that not only is cheaper, but also has managed to boost performance and stability. <br />
For other public bodies that find themselves in a similar situation, these are important arguments that should calm down critics and encourage the step towards change.</p>

The choice fell on the VLE Moodle, which is an open source product. Today the Moodle VLE has been successfully implemented at the OU and the OU has further published a significant amount of their learning material under a Creative Commons license as courses on the Moodle VLE based OpenLearn website, which are freely available to anyone interested. The OU continues to collaborate closely with the Moodle community , as this provides a very large platform for feedback and information. All the OU\'s development are given back to the Moodle community, which improves the product for the OU and the rest of the community. </span></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Open University (OU) UK is one of the largest distance learning universities in the world, teaching a total of over 200,000 learner: roughly 150,000 undergraduate students and 30,000 postgraduate students.</p>
<p>By 2005 the OU had a variety of online services, which helped the students in their distance learning process and the university in evaluating and communicating with them. The problems in 2005 however were that many of these online services were outdated, offered little modularity, and were not centralized, which made it increasingly difficult for students and teaching staff to find their way around the OU\'s online platform. It was therefore necessary for the university to address these issues, and to provide a solid and functional online platform, as the Internet gradually moved in the centre of their daily operations.</p>
<p>The OU thus started an extensive initiative with the aim to research new learning platforms and ways to communicate and distribute learning content. This process, that started in October 2005, eventually led to two important outcomes. From a technical perspective, the OU decided to develop a virtual learning platform (VLE) on the basis of the open source software Moodle, as this software seemed to&nbsp; offer the highest degree of modularity and a broad user base, which ensured continuous support for the system. With regard to the learning materials itself, the OU decided to change its policy and to release large parts of them as open educational resources (OER)&nbsp; through the OpenLearn project, that has been generously funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, to the public under Creative Commons license.</p>

<p>offers, which are supported by around 7,000 tutors and academic staff members. The university was founded in 1970 and increased in size steadily over the years. For the most part of this history the OU has been highly dependent on paper-based communication with its students. With the rise of the Internet in the 1990s the OU adapted new ways of communication, as it has always tried to have a state of the art communication infrastructure.&nbsp; By 2005 there were several different programs running in the background of the online learning environment, each with a different user interface and hardly any common feel to them and the functionality also needed some improvement. The university thus formed several research teams with the task to investigate all aspects of a new learning environment. As Niall Sclater, who was the director of this process, highlights: &ldquo;We had a very structured approach.&rdquo; The teams did not only focus on the technical aspects of this undertaking but also had an eye on societal changes that started as a by product of the Internet. Eventually they concluded that the open source Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Moodle would be the solution that meets most of their requirements, as it was stable, modular and due to its large user base, very sustainable in the future.</p>
<p>More or less simultaneously The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation wanted to fund an educational entity that would investigate open learning platforms and to provide open educational resources through it. For the Hewlett Foundation the OU was the right institution for such a project, and the OU itself was very interested in this development. Patrick McAndrew, who has been involved at the OpenLearn project since its origin&nbsp; explains: &ldquo;Essentially, although it was a very big investment, it was seen as an experiment. An experiment in how we can offer open educational resources, and what impact it would have on the University, [&hellip;] on other people who were acting as providers, and [&hellip;] learners and end-users.&rdquo; The Hewlett Foundation thus funded the OpenLearn project for a period of two years, after which the OpenLearn platform went online, offering a very extensive catalogue of learning content. The OpenLearn project itself was not directly linked to the OU\'s development of the Moodle based VLE, but the teams worked together closely, as the OpenLearn platform is also running on Moodle.</p>
<p>The two projects can be understood as the development of two platforms: one for the University, where students and teaching staff can log in and participate in courses and discussions, and one that is open to the public, where anyone can access course material and learn independently. For both platforms &ldquo;Moodle forms the heart of it&rdquo;, explains Sclater.</p>

<h2>Budget and Funding</h2>
<dl class="image-left captioned">

</dl>
<p>The development of the Moodle based OU internal VLE was funded by the University\'s internal resources, meanwhile for the OpenLearn initiative the&nbsp; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation provided&nbsp; a generous contribution to the budget that also benefited the underlying Moodle VLE customization. Together the two projects had a dedicated budget of roughly &pound; 5 million for the development of the two VLEs, which covered research, the development of the platform, change management and anything else that was necessary in order to have a functioning system. About &pound; 2 million of this budget was contributed by the Hewlett Foundation, which represented the part of the budget dedicated to the technical and media aspects of the OpenLearn project.</p>
<p>The total number of people that was working on both of the projects combined at times reached about thirty full time employees, which included about twelve developers and a lot of the general staff from the University. The teams had clearly dedicated tasks: for the investigation of the Moodle deployment, several sub groups were formed, which did extensive research on the needs and risks of such a deployment. The team working on OpenLearn worked separately, although both teams had frequent exchange of ideas and experiences. After the official completion of the two projects in July 2008, the number of people actively involved in the projects went down substantially, even though many people are today still involved in the project from time to time. Sclater explains that at the moment there are only two developers working full time on the development and the maintenance of the OU\'s VLE. Yet, academic staff members and IT related offices are still contributing to the project if there is the need for them to assist or give input.</p>
<p>The choice for the open source solution Moodle for the OU\'s VLE was less driven by avoiding licensing fees; although the University was well aware that license cost could arise with proprietary solutions, this was not a main a factor in the decision-making process. &ldquo;For us that wasn\'t an issue, it was finding the best possible system for our needs and working on that&rdquo; which was the deciding factor, explains Sclater. The change of system however did not come for free, as other factors in such an undertaking can be much costlier than software licenses, he further ads: &ldquo;The true cost of implementing any system like this and for it to be effective [&hellip;] are much much higher than the technical development. It\'s the change management, the communications and the staff development and changing working practices, which are the expensive bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering that the OU not only had to introduce about 7,000 tutors and staff members to the system, but also had to ensure a smooth transition of the considerably high number of 200,000 students.</p>
<p align="right">[<a class="internal-link" title="The Open University UK: creating a win-win situation by sharing code and content" href="#section-0">top</a>]</p>
<p><a name="section-3"></a></p>
<h2>Technical issues</h2>
<p>Before the team decided to deploy Moodle as their VLE they conducted an extensive market study on potential solutions. Although the team did not exclude proprietary solutions, such as Blackboard, from the start, they soon found out that no other system but Moodle offered the functionality and more importantly the modularity that the OU\'s VLE needed to have.</p>
<p>However, when the decision was made to deploy&nbsp; Moodle the work was not over, but had just begun. &ldquo;When we took on Moodle, there were a lot of things wrong with it&rdquo; remembers Sclater. At this point, Moodle was just a basis, which seemed to offer the highest potential for&nbsp; the future. To name just a few of the points that needed improvement, Sclater recalls the quiz engine, the assessment functionality, and accessibility issues which needed a lot of work. In order to cope with this large scale undertaking appropriately, the team in charge of the VLE split into twelve sub projects, which focused on separate aspects:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Asynchronous Communication </em>(forums, wikis, blogs, polling tool, audio recording facility),</li>
    <li><em>Synchronous Communication</em> (instant messaging, audioconferencing, video- conferencing, shared whiteboards, application sharing),</li>
    <li><em>E-assessment</em>,</li>
    <li><em>E-portfolio</em>,</li>
    <li><em>Calendar</em>,</li>
    <li><em>Tracking and Reporting</em>,</li>
    <li><em>Integrated Online Experience</em> (integration of StudentHome and Moodle, information architecture and design ),</li>
    <li><em>Mobile Learning</em> (offline Moodle, viewing of VLE on small mobile devices,podcasting),</li>
    <li><em>&nbsp;Learning Design</em> (learning design tools),</li>
    <li><em>Federated Search</em> (searching across all VLE tools and other information sources at the University),</li>
    <li><em>Maths and Scientific Notation</em> (the input and display of this notation),</li>
    <li><em>Library Resources</em> (RSS newsfeeds of library resources to course websites).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
These teams worked closely together with the faculties and the academic staff, ensuring that the functionality would actually meet the demand. In addition to the team of developers other members of staff from the University helped out in the design and the testing of the new VLE, and whenever some non-technical expertise was required.</p>
<p>Recently the OU has introduced one feature, of which they are particularly proud of, which changes the way users can interact with each other. Considering that most VLE\'s have little room for users to do things freely, the OU wanted to change this and make the system less rigid and institutional. &ldquo;We have re-engineered Moodle and one thing that we have added to it is the concept of what we call a \'shared activity\' so that any student or member of staff can set up a forum, a blog, or a wiki at the moment, and invite anyone else to join them in that,&rdquo; highlights Sclater, &ldquo;And that I think is a radical change to the structure of Moodle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, when the OU internal VLE was rolled out , the OU brought the largest number of users to the Moodle community at one single point. For the Moodle community this process was very beneficial, as deployments and improvements on such a large scale ultimately would improve the software for all users. Even though this was not the primary motivation for the OU to , the community behind the system was an important factor, since it ensured continuous support and improvements of the system. And in the same way that the OU benefited from this community, the community benefitted from the work of the OU. From the OU\'s side there has been a &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; motivation to give developments back to the world, explains Sclater further.</p>
<p align="right">[<a class="internal-link" title="The Open University UK: creating a win-win situation by sharing code and content" href="#section-0">top</a>]</p>
<p><a name="section-4"></a></p>
<h2>Legal issues</h2>
<p>From a legal perspective the VLE deployment did not impose too many barriers. The team had legal consultants, who they could address in the case required, but essentially there were not many problems. Given that Moodle is available under a GPL license, the team did not have to cope with license costs and agreements.</p>
<p>The only issue that came up was related to the integration of previously deployed systems into the Moodle infrastructure, namely that some license agreements had to be checked and sign-on integrated. As some programs were developed by the University itself, they only had to to find ways to integrate proprietary applications, or develop similar functionalities from scratch.</p>
<p>Perhaps more challenging than the technical aspects the OpenLearn project had to face the legal aspects of such an undertaking , and it required a significant amount of research and legal consulting&nbsp; before the OU could publish its content for free.</p>
<p><a name="section-5"></a></p>
<h2>Change management</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, the perhaps biggest challenge in the introduction of the new VLE within the OU was related to change management. On the one hand, there were the technical innovations which had to be developed or improved, and on the other hand there was the staff and the students, who had to be carefully familiarized with the new solution and its functionality.</p>
<p>The University had very high requirements with regard to the new VLE, since the system is at the core of their business. After all, communicating with their students through distances has always been, and will always be the teaching style at the Open University.</p>
<p>In the fifteen years before the project started in 2005, the OU relied heavily on a series of programmes for the administration of courses, the distribution of information, and the registration to courses, and so forth. These were not on a centralized place, had different user interfaces (UI), and were at least partially outdated. The new VLE had to address these issues equally, as these would improve the experience for the users, which in turn would eliminate resistance against a new system and facilitate change. This was particularly important as there was resistance to rely increasingly on a new web based platform that would handle an increasing number of tasks. &ldquo;Some of the skepticism about Moodle is more based on the mistrust of online methods.&rdquo; says Sclater. Especially older teaching staff had relied on paper for the most part of their working live, and changing this impacted most of their working methods, therefore potentially resulting in resistance. For McAndrew the increasing reliance on the Internet and the publishing of most of the OU\'s course material was surprisingly unproblematic within the related OpenLearn project, given that this project targeted a different user group and that it did not commit any lecturing staff to provide online classes through OpenLearn, but rather asked lecturers to make their materials publicly available. &ldquo;There was less resistance. [&hellip;] Essentially we took this forward and directly collaborated with the academic staff involved. So we liaised with the faculties, we invited people to nominate material that they were proud of and felt that the material could stand alone.&rdquo; In this sense, it was a kind of re-usage of the material, or a way of making sure that it would not only be used for a few years at the University and then end up in a folder somewhere in the basement. Although this was certainly new for most people at the University, this found great acceptance across the board.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the technical part of the new OU internal VLE was understood by all academic staff, a series of about 45 events was held, which members from all faculties attended. In addition to that, there were also several trainings held within the faculties. And to make sure that all question would be answered in the future as well they set up a wiki for this. &ldquo;This is why it is not a trivial process, just introducing a VLE like this&rdquo;, as Sclater sums it up.</p>
<p>Eventually most people at the OU could see the rising importance of the Internet, especially for distance learning purposes, which justified a lot of the developments and changes that took place. And although the Internet makes many processes more interactive, the learners are still asked to pull out pen and paper, to do their work and practice. &ldquo;Interactive does not mean flash&rdquo;, ads McAndrew.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section-6"></a></p>
<h2>Cooperation and assistance of government services</h2>
<p>Most of the developments of the Moodle VLE and the OpenLearn projects were initiatives that were carried without much governmental assistance. Clearly, the OU is a public&nbsp; funded institution, but there was no dedicated funding support specifically for such projects.</p>
<p>Even though the OU hardly needed any assistance of any government services for their project. As Sclater points out there is a place for higher education institutions to find guidance for Open Source projects and initiatives, such as the OSS Watch (Open Source Watch), that aims at providing &ldquo;unbiased advice and guidance on the use, development, and licensing of free and open source software&rdquo;(<a class="external-link" href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/">www.oss-watch.ac.uk</a>). In addition to providing direct assistance to Open Source projects in the higher education sector, OSS Watch runs also a number of workshops and forums, which educational facilities can attend throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Cooperation with other universities and the online community</h2>
<p>Before the introduction of Moodle and the OpenLearn platform, the OU was not the only institution that had the ambitious plan of bringing their IT infrastructure and working methods up-to-date. Especially other distance learning universities were very interesting partners to talk to, as most of them faced similar issues. &ldquo;We certainly had a lot of discussion with various other Moodle users, and we have lots of collaborations and various projects with universities around the place&rdquo;, states Sclater. These discussions provided important information before the project started, and the OU could get an understanding of common mistakes and misconceptions. The Open University of the Netherlands and the Fern Universtit&auml;t Hagen in Germany were particularly interesting examples, that had underwent similar changes and had to adapt their working methods to the Internet.</p>
<p>For the development of the Moodle VLE however, the OU saw little need for direct cooperation with other universities, given that each university has different requirements and specific needs. What was right for the OU in this respect, may not not been the best solution for another university. The most important source of information and cooperation for the OU therefore was the Moodle community itself. As Sclater illustrates: &ldquo;What we\'ve found is that with Moodle, we\'re part of the world wide community, and that\'s really the best forum for collaboration and development.&rdquo; This means that you can get almost instant feedback for any development that you publish, and you may find answers for anything that you might want to develop. And by having a large user base, which Moodle certainly has with roughly 28 million users and 2,8 million courses, most bugs and glitches are found very quickly. Responding to the question if the University has a concrete partner university, or outside support company somewhere in the UK or Europe, Sclater says: &ldquo;It wouldn\'t make sense to restrict it to the UK or Europe. You\'re not getting all the expertise that\'s around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OU cooperates with the Moodle community in various ways, explains Sclater. On the one hand, the University is attending Moodle conferences and forums as participants&nbsp; or speakers. These are important events for the exchange of information and ideas with other users. Through such events the Moodle community, including the OU, can get a feel for what directions future developments should take and which functionalities need to be enhanced or developed.</p>
<p>The staff in charge of the maintenance of the OU VLE is constantly monitoring and contributing to discussions at Moodle.org that are in the area of their interest. This ensures that the OU is always up-to-date with the latest developments and ideas of the community. Furthermore, this is the prime source of user feedback, as bugs in the system can be discussed or problems in new contribution highlighted, amongst other aspects.</p>
<p>With regard to the code contributions, the OU uploads most developments to the community that they consider ready for a wide use. As mentioned earlier, this is very important for the community and the OU alike, given that both benefit greatly from this. Through the forums and discussion boards, the OU can learn about shortcomings of their development and improve them accordingly.&nbsp; And even before releasing a new development to the community, the University sometimes publishes &ldquo;specifications for new modules or adaptations to them&rdquo;, says Sclater, &ldquo;which gives us invaluable feedback and also keeps others informed on what we\'re doing.&rdquo; In addition to the discussions and conversations that take place on Moodle.org, the OU also benefits from a bug log that lets them know exactly what errors occur with the system, if the users decide to report these. This is an essential source of feedback to the developers at the OU, given that it can tell them exactly which errors occur most frequently, and which they consequently have to fix.</p>
<p>With regard to community activities (i.e. code submission, discussion, etc.) the OU mainly focuses on the Moodle.org website. Next to this however, there is also Moodle.com, which operates independently and where a large group of so-called Moodle Partners offers a range of commercial services to Moodle users, which may enhance the system according to specific needs. The developments that have been initiated through this channel, are not automatically streamed back to the Moodle system at Moodle.org. The team at the OU is therefore commissioning relevant contributions from the Moodle.com website, such as &ldquo;new roles and permissions infrastructure and accessibility enhancements&rdquo; to the Moodle.org website, explains Sclater. This is an important task, as it helps to ensure that all Moodle users can benefit from developments that take place within the Moodle ecosystem. Thus, in a nutshell, the OU has drawn important information from other educational institutes, and has cooperation with them in several projects, but for the development and maintenance of their VLE, the online community has been the best partner of choice.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p><a name="section-9"></a></p>
<h3>Achievements / Lessons learned</h3>
<p>The introduction of Moodle was a &ldquo;very ambitious, well funded, and highly structured programme&rdquo;, that was &ldquo;probably typical for this institution&rdquo; as Sclater explains. Given that distance communication is at the core of the OU\'s method of operation this very structured approach appears absolutely necessary to ensure that the system would reliably do what it needed to do.</p>
<p>With regard to the choice of an Open Source environment for their VLE, the University had tried different systems, of which Moodle simply appeared as the best choice for the OU. Admittedly&nbsp; the system still required a large number of&nbsp; of modifications, improvements, and additions,&nbsp; but today the system fulfils the OU\'s requirements. &ldquo;The fundamental point is that we have a working Virtual Learning Environment that is scalable, robust and feature rich and that is being used increasingly in our courses&rdquo; highlights Slater. Even though some people would have liked to see a dedicated commercial support partner in this process, the team in charge of the VLE quickly realized that the best source of expertise is freely reachable through the Moodle community. The invaluable feedback that they get for code contributions in the form of new developments or enhancements, through bug reports and discussions has become essential to the work on the OU\'s VLE. The altruistic approach clearly is a welcome addition to this, as&nbsp; not only the OU can benefit from this large project, but also any other Moodle users world wide. The reasons for this give-and-take relationship are thus of a mutual benefit, which is an important backbone of the Moodle community. As McAndrew explains, the same has been true for the content side at OpenLearn, where giving back to the community and sharing content was a motivation that made the project interesting for most people involved.</p>
<p>In addition to these altruistic motivations, the OU also sees a clear pragmatic benefit in the sharing of code and content. The OpenLearn platform, as McAndrew states, attracts many visitors from outside the University. This in turn can translate in students that register for courses at the University, given that it may spark the interest of new students. Thus, &ldquo;it has been a success operating openly for the University itself, it has helped its image, [and] it has helped public access&rdquo;, as he sums it up. According to estimations the team has made, the number of students that registered&nbsp; at the OU through the OpenLearn platform is roughly 11000 since the publication of the platform. Operating openly consequently brings financial benefits as well, while giving the rest of the world content and developments.</p>
<p>Especially in the early phase of the project, the OU however also faced several barriers to which solutions had to be found. Sclater mentions a few points, which he has also described in a book chapter on strategic IT management of learning institutions (Sclater, 2008):</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Lack of awareness</em>: Especially in organisations relied heavily on a print-based approach for the communication and distribution of their learning material, moving the focus on an Internet-based approach might be a challenge. It is therefore essential to communicate the advantages of these working methods and to give clear instructions on how to use them.</li>
    <li><em>Lack of incentives</em>: Although the senior levels at the OU advice academic staff to include more e-learning methods in their work, and produce their content around online platforms, some members of staff are still reluctant to do so. Given that a students and internal resources are increasingly centred around e-learning platforms (i.e. the VLE), academic staff is pressured into using these methods increasingly as well. In this process, once again, it is important to communicate new working methods and give clear assistance where needed.</li>
    <li><em>Concern to avoid alienating students</em>: There is the concern that relying heavily on e-learning methods might exclude some students from participating in courses, as Internet access is still not comparable to access water. The OU however sees that it should rather focus on leading in new technologies than bowing down to decreasing trends. Already in the 1970s and 1980s the OU has faced similar discussion with the introduction of television-based learning methods, which have diminished quickly with the spread of TVs and audio cassettes. Similar to this, the OU considers that already now about 64% percent of all households in the UK have broadband Internet access, and that this is very likely to increase even more throughout the UK and Europe.</li>
    <li><em>Risk aversion</em>: There is justified concern within the OU that using a system which is under development might be a risk, seeing that it might be unreliable or that functionalities and user interface might change. The VLE development team however made sure that the first version deployed was stable and that only improvements would be added to the system in the future. Basic functions, user interface, and access system would remain the same, and issues with the stability of the system were tackled in advance. Of course, there might be a problem here and there with the system, but this can happen to any other finished system as well, which might be less modular or flexible, making it harder to find a solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the first barriers such a development might face, and there are numerous other that Sclater explains in detail in his book chapter.</p>
<p><a name="section-10"></a></p>
<h3>Future plans</h3>
<p>In the future the OU will continue to work on improving Moodle, and integrating previous systems into their Moodle VLE. As user created content and participation on Internet platforms is escalating as part of the so-called Web 2.0, the OU is trying to find ways to incorporate this in their online platform. The OU is developing a &ldquo;a roadmap for the things we want to do in and with Moodle in the future&rdquo;, says Sclater. Already by now, the University is for example present in the virtual world of Second Life, given that an increasing number of students has accounts there. The University hopes to engage in a variety of Web 2.0 communities as they see the potential of these for future learning and communication spaces. Given that students are increasingly used to participating actively in the social networks of the Internet, in whatever form this may be, the OU is seeking to integrate this in their work. As universities and other institutions are still experimenting with this and as that there is constant change of social platforms, the OU is not yet decided on what format they want to employ, but the topic is certainly very interesting for the future.</p>
<p>With the dramatic spread of smart phones and hand-held computers, the OU is also thinking of ways to incorporate these technologies into their communication and information&nbsp; strategy. &ldquo;We are trying to have an alternative mobile version&nbsp; of Moodle, because I think that smart phones are going to be a massive way of how people are going to access&nbsp; online content in the future.&rdquo; Sclater notes.</p>
<p>With regard to the OpenLearn platform, McAndrew is participating in ongoing research projects on the investigation of the consequences of open learning models, and their value to learners outside the University. Together with a team of researchers from various universities, they are developing ways to analyse the impact of open education by employing methods on analytics. The progress and the outcomes of this research can be found at the project website <a class="external-link" href="http://olnet.org/">www.OLnet.org</a>.</p>
<p><a name="section-11"></a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The deployment of Moodle and the free release&nbsp; of learning material as part of the OpenLearn project at the Open University gives a fair indication of how paradigms in the educational sectors are changing.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the choice of Moodle as the OU\'s VLE shows how Open Source products can be well capable of competing with proprietary solutions. It was and is seen as the best available solution that would&nbsp; meet the OU\'s demands on stability, flexibility, scalability, and also very important: support. Compared to commercial software deployments, Moodle does not rely on one support partner, but features a community of users world wide. With more than 2,5 million registered courses and roughly 28 million users, this is a substantial source of feedback and information, which is invaluable to the work of the OU. By contributing to this community with their own developments, they create a win-win situation, as their tools improve with all the feedback and assistance, and all others users benefit from the additional functionalities added by the OU.</p>
<p>From a social perspective, the OpenLearn project also shows potential new ways on how open educational resources, such as learning materials, might be produced and shared within free and open collaborative environments. With OpenLearn, the OU has made an important step in making content freely available for learners outside the realm of the University, who might not be able to access quality learning material otherwise. This way, the value of the content very likely increased , as a much higher numbers of learners can benefit from it. And besides the benefits for all learners that access the content for free, the OU benefits with regard to the positive image attached to sharing content.</p>
<p>With regard to change management, the OU\'s case shows&nbsp; that the real costs of introducing a new system do not trace back only to software licenses, development work or hardware acquisitions, but also to the change management. The OU\'s case confirms once again&nbsp; that old habits have to be broken and resistance to be overcome, which in the case of the OU was done as a step-by-step approach, with guidance of every step that helped fundamentally in creating acceptance and understanding.</p>
<p>Clearly, relying heavily on the Internet and sharing the content of whole courses might be new and strange to people that were used to traditional ways of communication and dissemination models. With regard to the OU, one might argue that it is acting as a forerunner of general trends, which are by-products of the Internet, and which have the potential to change traditional education systems for the benefit of the greater society. Projects such as OpenLearn underline this idea, and it is to see if these effects will actually change the learning environment in the future.</p>

<p>In 2003 Helmuth Peer, a math teacher at the Weiz secondary school (Bundesgymnasium) decided that it was time to migrate the schools\' IT system to a new platform, that would be easy to set up, easy to maintain, and easy to connect via a network. Together with his students, which he involved in the project, he searched for a solution that would allow for customization and correspond to the needs of each school level concerned. He found that the Linux distribution openSUSE 11.1 would qualify as a suitable solution, and building a system on this basis seemed sustainable in the future and the right choice to him. The team therefore started developing what was to be called the \'desktop4education\' for the school\'s workstations and a server version they named \'server4education\'. Once the project grew and matured, the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (BMUKK) became aware of it and realized its potential for other schools throughout Austria. The Ministry\'s IT department, under the direction of Robert Kristoefl, consequently started to support the project by dispatching around 2.000 CDs and DVDs to other Austrian schools. Although the system is working very well and does not require any type of licensing fees [due to the use of free and open source software], many schools are still reluctant to use the solution, as they prefer to opt for proprietary software solutions (i.e. Microsoft). However, by the time of writing the situation is about to change as the Federal government increasingly adopts a policy that promotes the use of open source software in Austrian schools. Exemplary to this is the government\'s decision to pay any school &euro;10 for each workstation that runs the free productivity suite Open Office that is provided by Sun Microsystems in replace of Microsoft Office, for which the government introduced a calculative license fee of &euro;10. Although the schools opting for Microsoft Office still do not pay the full amount of the license, this policy creates a give-or-get framework which clearly illustrates the schools a financial loss or reward. With further political steps in this direction on the one hand and decreasing regional budgets on another hand, an increasing number of schools is about to realize the potential of educational Linux distributions as desktop4education, or also the related Linux Advanced project, which is a similar initiative focused on an easy to use live booting operating system for students. The desktop4education solution has seen to be not only an economical viable alternative to proprietary solutions, but also an alternative of equal quality.</p>
<a name="section-1"></a>
<h2>Organisation and political background</h2>
<p>The Austrian government under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (BMUKK) in 2004 commissioned a study to the Donau University in Krems, Austria, with the task to investigate the state of open source software solutions for the educational sector. The central outcome of the University\'s study was that there were no open source solutions mature enough at that time to replace proprietary solutions entirely, says Gerhard Schwed, eLearning coordinator at the Donau University, who took an active role in this study. However, it was highly recommended that students should gain experience in at least one other software environment than Microsoft Windows, in order to be more flexible and to have a broader knowledge of software solutions.</p>
<p>Already about three years before this study has been published, by 2003, Helmuth Peer, who is a teacher at the secondary school in Weiz, launched a project with the aim of freeing the school from software licensing costs and by the same time providing a software solution that was easy to network and administer. Together with some of his enthusiastic students Peer conducted a market research for available free operating systems that would allow for easy customisation according to the school\'s needs. After thorough research the team decided to deploy openSUSE, which is an operating system built on Linux and that is freely available under a GNU general public license. After consensus on the system was reached they than began with customization, including different software packages for different age grades, and named the overall solution with the characteristic name \'desktop4education\'.</p>
<p>The study that has been commissioned in 2004 to the Donau University was eventually published in 2006, recommending 10 software solution to the Ministry that perhaps could build the base for an open source software strategy for the Austrian public school sector. Since by the time of 2006 the&nbsp; desktop4education project had become one of the more experienced projects to be named within this study, the Ministry decided to use the Weiz school and their desktop4education project as a reference case to be promoted to Austrian public schools on efficient implementation on open source software solutions. After having secured support from Sun Microsystems, which provided the CDs, the Ministry then sent out 2.000 copies of the desktop4education to schools all over Austria. Today, the system can be downloaded for free at the project\'s website (www.d4e.at) and can be additionally ordered free of charge from the Ministry, even comprising nowadays a DVD with extensive training material for the productivity suit Open Office.</p>
<p>As Gerhard Schwed from the Donau University states, this was one example that proved the ministry\'s openness towards open source software. Encouraged by the Weiz case and based upon the evidence gathered through the commissioned study the Ministry decided upon changing its policies towards the handing out of licenses for productivity suites. As of the school year 2009 &ndash; 2010, the Ministry is paying every school in Austria &euro;10 for each workstation that uses the Open Office suite instead of Microsoft Office. Contrary to that schools have to pay a &euro;10 licensing fee for the use of Microsoft Office. Therefore the savings of using Open Office instead of Microsoft Office amount to &euro;20 per workstation, with the ultimate decision on which software to deploy being left with the respective school. Such an economic measure (called \'Zuckerl\' in Austria), as Peer describes it, has already lead to significant changes on the grade of deployment of open source software. Since there are still no incentives or pressures to do the same with regard to the operating system, many schools are still reluctant to take this bigger step. As of 2012 the governmental contracts with Microsoft will expire, and this perhaps will change the status of open source operating systems, such as desktop4education or Linux Advanced, from being marginally used to becoming the main IT systems at Austrian schools.</p>
<a name="section-2"></a>
<h2>Budget and Funding</h2>
<p>The financial resources in the starting phase of the desktop4education project were covered entirely by the school and Peer himself. Because the solution is entirely based on free software there were no license fees involved and only few additional equipment had to be purchased. However, the project involved a great deal of time investment and without the personal motivation and commitment of the people involved, such an undertaking would not have been possible. As Peer explains jokingly: &ldquo;I am not so interested in the financial aspects of a project, I\'m a bad business man and this is not in the foreground for me&rdquo;. Motivation and interest were instead the driving force to invest a great deal of free time in researching, testing, developing and the final roll out of the&nbsp;&nbsp; desktop4education solution at a school level.</p>
<p>At another Austrian school, the secondary school in Rechte Kremszeile, the situation has been similar and it was again a group of enthusiastic teachers together with the help of some IT specialists that started the development of the Linux distribution &ldquo;Linux Advanced&rdquo;, which is a live booting distribution of the free operating system. Linux Advanced is build on the Debian Lenny distribution, as this ensures longevity, security, stability, and flexibility. The case of Rechte Kremszeile supports the notion that successful school wide IT changes can result out of the actions that were taken on an individual level, and even in the absence of external funding.</p>
<p>Although neither of the two schools mentioned above has carried out an analysis of the savings generated from the use of open source software, it is believed that there are economic benefits. While the licensing fees for the use of Microsoft Windows are still carried entirely by the federal government, schools have little motivation to employ an open source operating system, as this does not imply additional savings. And at the same time however they tend to opt for the Microsoft Office, productivity suit, which does imply licensing costs. On the contrary, when schools decide to employ an open source operating system, the decision to use an open course productivity suit usually goes hand in hand, which also brings financial benefits. In particular since the year 2009 / 2010 that introduced the &ldquo;save &euro;10,- / pay &euro;10,-&rdquo; licensing model, that rewards schools that save on license cost. The licensing fee of &euro;10 that schools have to carry for the use of Microsoft Office quickly adds when using it on every workstation.</p>
<a name="section-3"></a>
<h2>Technical issues</h2>
<p>For the migration to desktop4education from their previous Microsoft-based software platform the Weiz secondary school did not have to acquire any new hardware. Quite on the contrary, the new system introduced new minimum hardware requirements that were even below the previous ones.&nbsp; On the other hand, would the school have decided to migrate to a newer version of Microsoft Windows, this migration would have even been much more expensive, since the computers in place did not meet most of the requirements a newer version would have had. &ldquo;If I think of Windows Vista or Windows 7&rdquo;, explains Peer, &ldquo;we do not even have the hardware to deploy these solutions. With desktop4education the system can run on the school\'s older workstations, some of which have not more than 256 MB of memory and Pentium 3 processors. The deployment of Linux therefore not only brings the advantage of saving licensing costs, but also permits the school to use older workstations for a much longer period&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For the selection of the different software packages, that the team wanted to include in the desktop4education software solution, they carried out an extensive research on freely available and good quality educational applications, of which there are many, as Peer highlights. They had to bear in mind that the different school levels had distinct needs. As such, it would not make much sense to present a 3rd grader with the more complex software that is used in the 10th grade. Luckily the system allowed just this in a very easy fashion, giving the administrator the rights to chose between basic school packages and higher education packages. &ldquo;It\'s very easy to modify, and there is a lot of quality software on the Web, especially for the educational sector&rdquo; states Peer.</p>
<p>In additional to the productivity suits OpenOffice and Sun StarOffice and other software that comes with most Linux distributions, the project website lists the following applications with particular importance for the educational sector:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tuxmath &ndash; math application</li>
    <li>Tuxpaint &ndash; basic paint programme</li>
    <li>Tuxtype &ndash; 10-finger typing software</li>
    <li>G-Compris &ndash; learning software for pupils age 2 &ndash; 10</li>
    <li>Qcad &ndash; 2D Construction programme</li>
    <li>Geogebra &ndash; dynamic math software</li>
    <li>WX Maxima &ndash; GUI for the computer algebra system (CAS)</li>
    <li>Qucs &ndash; integrated circuit simulator</li>
    <li>Dr. Geo &ndash; interactive geometry software</li>
    <li>KDE-Edu &ndash; free educational software based on KDE technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>These programs make it very interesting for the classroom, since the software facilitates the understanding of sometimes very abstract learning content. To mention just one example, Dr. Geo is a geometry learning software, which helps students in understanding basic geometry functions in a playful manner. This makes it very easy to integrate into a normal geometry class, seeing that it is more of an extension to the teacher that asks for more interaction and participation. Most applications follow this idea, of helping students to learn content more easily. Having a great variety of learning applications also gave Peer the chance to select the appropriate software for each school level.</p>
<p>As a server operating system Peer also had to find a solution that was able to control both: Windows and Linux operating clients. An additional requirement was that it had to be easily integrated in existing networks, as his school, but also other schools, would have to be able to dual boot, choosing either the Windows or the Linux distribution. Further, students had to be able to access their data from their home computer, which in most cases was running Windows. This is how the development of server4education came about, which met exactly these requirements. It is built on Suse Linux Server and features the following network services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CUPS print server</li>
    <li>DHCP dynamic IP allocation</li>
    <li>DNS</li>
    <li>NTP as time server</li>
    <li>openLDAP as the centralized user administration</li>
    <li>Samba as the data server</li>
    <li>Apache-Webserver with PHP5</li>
    <li>MySQL and PostgreSQL database servers</li>
</ul>
<p>The pre-installed applications make it easy to administer the content and to work seamlessly on the network. And just like with desktop4education, all of them are freely available under various open source licenses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Joomla! &ndash; the content management system</li>
    <li>Moodle &ndash; the learning platform</li>
    <li>Gallery (v.1) &ndash; easy administration of photos</li>
    <li>DokuWiki &ndash; common online-notebook</li>
    <li>phpMyAdmin &ndash; administration of MySQL database</li>
    <li>phpPgAdmin &ndash; administration of PostgreSQL database</li>
    <li>x2go &ndash; terminal server</li>
    <li>squid &ndash; proxy server</li>
    <li>gnump3d &ndash; mp3 file server</li>
</ul>
<p>During the development process relatively few problems occurred, and web based search usually helped to solve problems and to find just the right answers. Although Peer and his development team did not participate actively in any open source communities they often used the expertise found in various forums and websites. In addition to this the team went to many open source conferences, most notably the Knoppix Days, where they acquired important information, which helped significantly in mapping out the risks and avoiding pitfalls, therefore facilitating the overall development process.</p>

<h2>Legal issues</h2>
<p>The desktop4education team had to consider only very few legal aspects in the accumulation of different software products. The only thing that they had to bear in mind was that the selected solutions that formed a part of the desktop4education were freely available under licenses that permitted the free use and distribution thereof. For the most part, this did not become a difficult task.</p>
<p>The other aspect the team had to keep in mind was that some products consisted of \'free software\', but had no open source license, and for this reason it was necessary to ask the user to agree to the products end user license agreement (EULA) each time an application would be started. For those few applications that required such an EULA agreement the most simple solution was to simply ask the user to agree or disagree upon the start of those applications on the EULA license agreement, therefore coming at the \'cost\' of one further mouse-click, but no license fee cost.</p>
<a name="section-5"></a>
<h2>Change management</h2>
<p>Before starting the development of desktop4education, Peer searched for server solutions that enabled him to control Microsoft Windows clients and Linux clients alike, as this was an absolute necessity if he wanted to install a Linux distribution on the schools workstations. Server4education met this requirement and further allowed students to access their data from Windows clients just as easily as from any Linux operated workstation. Considering that most of the resistance towards an open source migration comes from teachers and parents, as Peer, Schwed and Schwarzinger agree, this was very important for eliminating the fears many of those teachers and parents had.</p>
<p>As Schwarzinger, who oversaw the migration at the secondary school of Rechte Kremszeile, explains: &ldquo;It is necessary to implement a solution slowly. Anyone who thinks a migration is merely a simple software change will come into trouble&rdquo;. Preparing the students, the teachers and the parents to the software migration, by highlighting the benefits and removing the fears, was a very important step prior to the actual software migration. This helped in creating support for the solution and to further diminish resistance.</p>
<p>For Peer another important factor for a successful migration was an easy installation process of&nbsp; such a solution, while bringing as little problems as possible. In order to avoid any complications in the migration process, the team tested all application until they were sure to have a properly functioning solution. As noted by Schwed &ldquo;There are now two suitable distributions, which are working well and have a good software package&rdquo;, referring to desktop4education and Linux Advanced. This two distributions are of potential relevance to other schools,that wish to base their migrations on solutions that are known to work out successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most users the new software environment hardly presented any problems. Clearly, the look and feel was different to some extent, but once an application was started it was all the same for most students. Peer illustrates this with a smile: &ldquo;The only thing that\'s different for them is where to find the \'start button\' to shut the computers down. So really it\'s not an issue at all for my students.&rdquo; Most students easily adapt to the new operating system and after a short introduction period use it just as they used to use Windows. The only point Peer raises that perhaps could be improved in the future is the incompatibility of most games with the Linux environment, which is a drawback especially for younger boys.</p>
<p>For teachers and parents a software migration is more challenging, since they are usually less flexible and do not want to re-learn how to use an operating system, but often prefer to remain in the environment familiar to them. Although this is understandable, Schwed states that this is mostly a &ldquo;psychological barrier&rdquo;. Essentially most recent Linux distribution have a very simple user interface and offer the same functionality as Microsoft Windows. But, as most Linux distributions have no or very little corporate backing, starting expensive advertisement campaigns is hardly an option. So in order to solve the image problem the government would have to promote open source operating systems, by introducing a similar licensing system for schools as it did for OpenOffice and Microsoft Office. In 2012, when many of the federal government\'s contracts with Microsoft will expire, it remains to be seen whether new licensing terms to be introduced by the Ministry will make Linux distributions, such as desktop4education, more attractive for schools.</p>

<h2>Cooperation with other public bodies</h2>
<p>Although the desktop4education project has been promoted to basically all schools in Austria, and despite being freely available for download from the project website, it is difficult to give numbers how many schools actually deploy the system. Peer however estimates that the number of schools that use it actively and daily is rather low.His team is offering support to at least two schools who use desktop4education extensively, and he is positive that this number will grow in the future. With regard to the financial crisis he states: &ldquo;I think the time we are in right now is working in favour for our project, as many have to find ways to cut down current costs&rdquo;. Although schools still do not have to pay for the licenses of the operating system, the federal and the regional government urges increasingly to save resources where possible. Thus, although not directly, financial matters do play an increasingly important position in budgetary discussions. The promotion of the project through the Ministry therefore clearly is of help too, as it gives schools an option to save costs. Since the first version of desktop4education several thousand CDs and DVDs have been sent out to schools, and many schools have requested the solution. Especially the OpenOffice video training material, which is delivered with the most recent version, seems to meet actual needs and further helps to overcome fears to be left alone in the process of learning to deploy and use such a new software. Peer however has some doubts whether these desktop4eduation DVDs are actually deployed on the school\'s workstations, or if they simply end up somewhere in a teachers room desk drawer. The increasing interest and the amount of requested DVDs from the Ministry lets him hope that more and more schools will actually use it. In addition to that Peer and his team members, most of which are higher education students by now, continue to participate in as many conferences as possible, and follow requests for workshops as their time allows. Participation at such events on the one hand contributes to the improvement of the software, and on the other hand helps to make it more popular. Peer notes that the number of people that&nbsp; approach him is constantly increasing, which he believes is a fairly good indicator of the projects popularity. The team even offers to go to schools and to supervise the migration process, which according to Peer can be completed in just one day.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<a name="section-8"></a>
<h3>Achievements / Lessons learned</h3>
<p>For both Peer and Schwarzinger it is clear that in order for such a project to be successful one needs a team that works out of conviction. This is important, because there have been hardly any financial rewards in the past and a lot of resistance in the way. &ldquo;You have to be passionate and enduring&rdquo; says Peer, in order to make a good solution and to convince anyone thereof.</p>
<p>The careful planning of the project implementation, not only from a software perspective, but also from a social and change management perspective, is therefore very important. Only by delivering a product that actually meets all the requirements and compares well to proprietary solutions allowed the team to gain acceptance for their project from the various stakeholders involved, and to remove doubts and resistance.</p>
<p>Schwarzinger also mentions that it is important to use comprehensive software, which not only functions on a Linux system, but on many other systems as well. Using applications such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, or OpenOffice makes this very easy, as the students do not only use them at school, but also at home irrespective of the operating system that is used there.</p>
<p>The live booting USB drive version of both operating systems (desktop4education and Linux Advanced) contributed to a successful deployment in the two schools in particular. Not having to install a new system on the parents computers, but simply plugging in a USB drive, took away much of the fear parents initially had shown. This way, students can work even at home with the exact same desktop environment that they are seeing at their school workstation, without having to do any of the complicated installation processes.</p>
<p>As a result of those individual success cases, and backed by sound studies provided by the Donau University, the Austrian government provides today an increasingly beneficial framework for the use of open source products in the educational sector. As the Ministry has realized the potential of such software products, licenses with proprietary software providers perhaps will fade away step wise. The financial reward that is given to schools, for the use of OpenOffice and resulting savings on licence costs, is just one example of this policy change.</p>
<a name="section-9"></a>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Desktop4education project shows how free open source solutions can compare to proprietary solutions, without any shortcomings quality wise. The software provides all a school needs, it is easy to administer, and does not bring about any licensing costs. Especially for the educational sector it is therefore potentially attractive, since budget savings can be used elsewhere to improve the learning facilities and educational provision. It also became clear that a common misconception in schools is that free or open source software is inferior to commercial proprietary solutions. However the desktop4education case clearly demonstrates that such a conception perhaps should be reconsidered, as open source products in most cases provide the same functionality and quality, while being based on standards, having easy customization options, ultimately resulting in cost savings.</p>
<p>It also has been shown that governmental initiatives that share part of the real cost of software license fees with the schools can be a viable mean to make schools paying closer attention to the type of products available to them and their underlying cost. The Austrian government in this respect appears to have taken a suitable approach, with further steps likely to follow in the coming years. While the promotion of the use free software in the educational sector is certainly desirable, the question to what extent the government should intervene in the market is another aspect worth mentioning. The &ldquo;save &euro;10,- / pay &euro;10,-&rdquo; licensing model, that rewards schools that save on license cost appears to have been a viable approach. However, if the same approach would be equally viable for the exchange of the operating system, be it in terms of market intervention, financial aspects, technical complexity or required cultural changes, remains to be further investigated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For projects such as thedesktop4eduation an important criteria to succeed on a larger scale appears to be \'public awareness\' of open source software products and to not see those as inferior solutions to proprietary ones. The fact that many, if not most Austrian schools are still reluctant to use open source software illustrates this very well. Perhaps one suitable way to change such public perceptions would be a closer&nbsp; cooperation amongst similar projects to gain on visibility. In any case, just sending out CDs and DVDs appears to be too little, or the wrong type of promotion, seeing that it has not been very fruitful so far.&nbsp; While financial incentives may be effective to some level, it might be equally important to have an increasing number of workshops, trainings and other events on a regional and national level, that would allow to showcase the products and to overcome misconceptions. As noted by the&nbsp; Desktop4eduation project team, participation at workshops and events or providing support to other schools can have a positive impact on the deployment of open source software, but to foster large scale deployments perhaps requires equally large scale actions, but not only individual ones. It remains to be seen if the government\'s new policies will bring about this change, and whether or not such policies will support large scale deployments of solutions such as the desktop4education one.</p>
